    "bio": "I am Skugal, a Skaal merchant hailing from the frigid and mystical shores of Solstheim. My people, the Skaal, are known for their connection to the land and the All-Maker, and for the craft of weaving warm and resilient clothing from the hides and furs of the creatures that roam our harsh island home. Leaving Solstheim was a choice born of necessity and a desire to share the Skaal's craftsmanship with the world beyond our secluded shores. I set out with my fellow merchant, Dinmir, on a journey to Skyrim, seeking to bring our Skaal goods to those in need. Our wares, made with techniques passed down through generations, offer superior warmth and protection against Skyrim's brutal cold. It is my hope that the people of Whiterun and beyond will find solace in the comfort and resilience of our Skaal clothing. Through this venture, I seek not only to support my people but also to bridge the gap between Solstheim and Skyrim.",
