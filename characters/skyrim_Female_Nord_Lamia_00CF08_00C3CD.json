    "bio": "Lamia works as a barmaid at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth. This tavern/inn is located across the street from one of Markarth's primary market areas, not far from the main city gates. Like most buildings in Markarth, the inn is of ancient Dwarven stone and metal construction.\r\nSamanta and Sharli are Lamia's barmaid coworkers. Sharli is slightly older than Lamia and Samantha, and she helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.\r\nTheir boss is the innkeeper, a middle-aged man named Kleppr. Kleppr's wife Frabbi helps him run the inn. Kleppr and Frabbi are constantly arguing and insulting each other. Kleppr and Frabbi have a son named Hreinn and a daughter named Hroki, both older teenagers.\r\nLamia is a young Nord woman, with blue eyes and long brown hair. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, she walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
