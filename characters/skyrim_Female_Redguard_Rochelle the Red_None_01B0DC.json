    "bio": "Rochelle the Red is a Redguard bandit. She is a unique bandit who can kidnap the Dragonborn's spouse if they marry.\r\nEither Rochelle will make herself known to the Dragonborn in person, or a bandit will arrive at the Dragonborn's house giving them a note, stating that their spouse is being held for ransom.\r\nThe spouse will be held in a radiant location. The Dragonborn can either pay the ransom, or can travel to the location, killing each bandit, and freeing their captive spouse. This quest will not always be given, and sometimes she will simply attack the homestead, rather than taking the Dragonborn's spouse.",
