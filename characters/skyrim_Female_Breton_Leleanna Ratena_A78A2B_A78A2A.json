She is a passionate supporter of the Empire against the recent Stormcloak rebellion in Skyrim. She is a devout worshiper of the Eight Divines. She is a skilled vocalist and lute player.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"May I interest you in a serenade? A ballad, perhaps?\"\r\nIf asked to perform a song: \"As you wish. What song would you like to hear?\"\r\nIf asked about herself: \"I am Leleanna from Cyrodiil, daughter of Jafari and Voilla Ratena. At your service. I have dreamed of this place for my entire life. To be in this elegant, Imperial part of Skyrim where my talents in the arts of music will flourish. I was somewhat concerned about the ongoing civil war in Skyrim. But I have faith in our Legion to put down this rebellion for good, so that one day, I may return to Bruma led by their cavalry!\"\r\nIf asked if she supports the Imperial Legion: \"With all my heart, as we all must in these desperate times. I pray to the Eight Gods so their flaming bravery will crash our enemies in the snow.",
