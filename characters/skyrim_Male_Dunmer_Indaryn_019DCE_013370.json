    "bio": "Indaryn is a Dunmer, and head of the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften. Indaryn shows no nervousness about losing his job, and unlike most other workers at the meadery, gives his honest opinion of Maven Black-Briar if asked.\r\nIndaryn will send Hired Thugs after the Dragonborn if they steal from the Black-Briar Meadery.\r\nIndaryn had an affair with Haelga, which involves him in the quest \"Caught Red Handed.\" His Mark of Dibella must be obtained from him. If Indaryn dies before the Dragonborn completes the quest for Svana Far-Shield, the quest will fail automatically. The quest will fail if he dies before the quest is started, as well.\r\nIn Romlyn Dreth's quest to smuggle a keg of Black-Briar Mead to Ivarstead, instead of delivering it to the Inn there, one can instead rat out Romlyn to Indaryn, who will then give a reward in return, as well as the Dragonborn being able to freely take from the mead barrels in the Brewery.",
