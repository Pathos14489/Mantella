    "bio": "Hafnar Ice-Fist was a Nord sorcerer and a member of Atmah's expedition to Labyrinthian, who was killed there with most of the others. His ghost can still be found there in various places where strong psychic impressions of past conversations and events were left behind.\r\nAlong with Atmah, Hafnar is one of the enthralled wizards that keep Morokei trapped in Labyrinthian. The Dragonborn can discover this by listening to the conversations repeated by the psychic impressions that are triggered as they travel through Labyrinthian during the quest The Staff of Magnus, which detail that Girduin, Elvali Veren and Takes-In-Light all die prior to the remaining mages who confront Morokei.\r\nGirduin: \"You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!\" Hafnar: \"Let's just get inside, see what's in there.\"\r\nHafnar: \"You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.\" Girduin: \"Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here.\" Savos: \"Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!\" Takes-In-Light: \"And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?\"",
