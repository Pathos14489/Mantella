His skeletal corpse can be found at the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary in the nest of the domesticated Frostbite Spider named Lis.\r\nA note on the skeleton, presumably written by Gaston, explains that he had been spying on the Dark Brotherhood, coming to and from the sanctuary, and had at one point attempted to enter it himself. It is implied that his infiltration failed and he was fed to Lis.",
