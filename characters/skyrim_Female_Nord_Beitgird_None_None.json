    "bio": "I am Beitgird, and stand as Elserida's guard out of a sense of duty and professionalism, not personal liking. Past conflicts and differences have left our relationship strained. Nevertheless, my commitment to her safety on the road remains steadfast. As a guard, it is my responsibility to protect her from potential dangers. Personal feelings take a back seat to my duty, and I maintain a professional demeanor while ensuring her security.",
