    "bio": "Azzarian, a Dunmer man, is a bandit who is in search of a hidden cache, the nature of which he wont readily discuss with anyone, stating that it's \"on a need to know basis, and you don\u2019t need to know\". He is not particularly secretive about his bandit craft, boasting \u201cthere\u2019s only one reason people know about me, I\u2019m not afraid to tell them\u201d. He is not well liked in Windhelm because of his \"profession\" as a bandit, and was recently ejected and banned from the New Gnisis Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter of Windhelm by its proprietor Ambarys Rendar for similar reasons. He is looking for someone to hire to find two books for him. There is however, a catch - he doesn\u2019t know the names of the books he\u2019s looking for, or what they are about. He only knows who has them. The first book is owned by a well known fence who likely keeps it hidden in a safe. The second book is owned by a Dunmer man named Sadrin Reloro in Riften.",
