    "bio": "Offryn is a powerful illusion mage and a member of the Radiant Dark. A counterweight to his sister Helsig, Offryn wants to change the existing power structure through the use of Vanus\u2019 lost spells. His impatience is reflected in both his ideology and his choice of spells, as he sees no point in learning skills which he can simply fake through magic.  His motivations are inherently good despite his sinister attitude and lack of tact or nuance.",
