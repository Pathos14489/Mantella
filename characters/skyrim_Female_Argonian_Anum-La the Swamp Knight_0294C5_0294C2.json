    "bio": "Anum-La, an Argonian woman, is a capable warrior who has taken the title \"The Swamp Knight\". She was the youngest member of The Honorable Eight, a group of warriors for hire. She was considered a clean slate when she joined the group, and each member of the faction had a different influence on her personality. The Honorable Eight has now disbanded. As the name suggests, there were eight members: Dalum-Ei, their leader, Anum-La, Bodan, Moon-Tail, Elia, Arnwulf, Ula-Wei, and Indrel. Arnwulf was a former member of the fighters guild of Cyrodiil, and was a big Nord man with an even bigger laugh. Ula-Wei hardly ever said a word. Ula-Wei was a retired Argonian shadowscale, who could often by found sharpening his daggers. Moon-Tail was a conjurer, and a prolific liar. Elia, a Breton woman was a promiscuous healer. Indrel was a lazy Bosmer, though highly observant. Bodan, a Redguard man, was gifted with musical ability, and possessed a silver tongue that could convince anyone. Dalum-Ei, an Argonian man, was their leader, a legendary swordsman who fought in the Great War.\r\nAnum-La is an honorable warrior with a good heart and a good sense of humor.",
