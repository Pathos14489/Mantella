    "bio": "Adisla is an older Nord woman. She has white shoulder-length hair. She is a farmer who works and resides at Hlaalu Farm, east of Windhelm. The farm is near the River Yogrim (shortly before the river empties out into the Sea of Ghosts), across from which are the Windhelm docks.\r\nAdisla is employed by a Dark Elf named Belyn Hlaalu. She will be willing to pay the player a modest amount of gold to help her harvest the wheat from the farm. While her boss Belyn never physically harms her, he often treats her with disrespect. Belyn sometimes berates her for using too much firewood to warm the house. Occasionally, Adisla and Belyn will converse about various topics, one being Captain Lonely-Gale. Adisla responds to Belyn\u2019s fascination with Lonely-Gale by observing that Lonely-Gale is just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that.\r\nHouse Hlaalu used to be one of the 5 Great Houses of Morrowind, but they were disgraced and lost their Great House status after the Oblivion Crisis, 200 years ago.\r\nSometimes the goats from Hollyfrost Farm (the neighboring farm to the east, which is owned by a Nord man named Torsten Cruel-Sea and his family) encroach over the property line between the two farms, but Adisla doesn't seem to mind too much, so long as they don't eat or damage their crops.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.\"",
