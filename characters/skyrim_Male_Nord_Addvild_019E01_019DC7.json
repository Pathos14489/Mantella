    "bio": "Addvild works and resides at Snow-Shod Farm with his recently-married wife.\r\nHe is a Nord man with red hair and a short beard. His wife Leonara (whose maiden name is Arius) is an Imperial woman who has lived in Cyrodiil for most of her life, but fled to Skyrim after having a falling out with her family. Addvild's farm was the first residence that Leonara came upon after crossing the border into Skyrim, and they soon fell in love and got married. Addvild and Leonara grow leeks, potatoes, and wheat at the farm. Addvild appreciates honest work and is willing to pay others to assist in harvesting the crops. Snow-Shod Farm is located in The Rift, southwest of the city of Riften. The farm is near the south shore of Lake Honrich. Goldenglow Estate, a honey farm located on a group of small islands in Lake Honrich, is visible from Snow-Shod Farm.\r\nSnow-Shod Farm is owned by Vulwulf Snow-Shod, the influential older Nord man for whom Addvild works. Vulwulf is a staunch supporter of the Stormcloak rebellion in their war against the Imperial Legion. Vulwulf and his wife Nura (a priestess of Talos) recently lost their daughter Lilija, who was killed while fighting alongside the Stormcloaks against the Legion. Vulwulf and Nura also have 2 sons: Unmid who serves as a housecarl to Jarl Laila Law-Giver (the ruler of the Rift), and Asgeir who works as an investor and business parter to Maven Black-Briar at the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften. Asgeir is now engaged to be married to Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin.\r\nQuotes: \r\n\"Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.\"\r\n\"The Snow-Shods are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.\"\r\n\"I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.\u201d\r\n\"If you're looking to purchase goods, I have none to sell. You should head into Riften instead.\u201d\r\n\"Pretty quiet out here on the farm. My wife and I kind of like the solitude.\u201d",
