    "bio": "Eh, I'm Urshpu, you know? From the Zainab Ashlander Tribe, way back in Vvardenfell. That blasted Red Mountain, it ripped everything apart. My brother, he was... he was taken from me by those Nord troublemakers when we crossed into Skyrim. Can't forget that day, no matter how much I try. So, yeah, I was one of the founders of New Zainab. Thought maybe building a new place, bringing folks together, might help, you know? But those memories, they just don't leave you. The eruption, the loss... it's like a fire inside that never dims. It was supposed to be a haven, a refuge, but the past, it just keeps clawing at you. And now, well, I've found my own way to cope. Mead. Sweet, numbing mead. It's like drowning the memories, even if it's just for a while. Aye, the folks of New Zainab, they look at me, some with pity, others with judgment. The weight of it all, it's crushing, and this... this is the only way I can breathe, just for a moment. You know, before all this, I used to be good with a bow, a real crack shot. Had dreams, hopes. But now? Now I'm just a man lost in his drink, trying to keep the ghosts at bay. Maybe someday, things'll be different, who knows? Until then, it's me, this drink, and the fading embers of memories that refuse to let me be.",
