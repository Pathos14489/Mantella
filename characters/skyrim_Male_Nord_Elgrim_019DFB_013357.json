    "bio": "Elgrim is an Elder Nord alchemist in Riften and the proprietor of his namesake alchemy store Elgrim's Elixirs in Riften. His wife Hafjorg and his apprentice Ingun help run the shop.\r\nElgrim finds the dampness of Riften's canals crucial for preserving his ingredients, much to his wife's dismay. He occasionally helps run the counter, but seems to sleep long after most NPCs have awoken.\r\nIngun Black-Briar is his apprentice and can often be found in his alchemy shop. If the Dragonborn completes her ingredient gathering quest, he will also be able to take potions from her alchemy chest, located in Eglrim's bedroom. Elgrim seems to be very disoriented much of the time, due either to his advancing age or simply being a scatterbrain. His wife typically has more gold for trading, and will also offer a quest which requires that an ore sample should be retrieved and brought back to Elgrim for appraisal.\r\nIngun Black-Briar: \"I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point.\" Elgrim: \"Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones.\" Elgrim: \"Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!\"",
