    "bio": "Madena, a Breton woman, serves as the court wizard in Dawnstar. Madena can often be found inside The White Hall (the Jarl\u2019s longhouse) in Dawnstar.\r\nDuring the day, Madena is willing to both sell and buy various spell tomes, mage robes, soul gems, and magical scrolls.\r\nMadena is a veteran of the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion 30 years ago. During the war, Madena killed many young Elven soldiers with her Destruction magic, which she regrets. Madena has since vowed never to use magic to harm others, but only to assist the people of Dawnstar. She heavily resists any attempts by the Jarl to pressure her into using her magic to assist the war effort in the Civil War, and has no desire to assist the Stormcloaks, nor the Imperial Legion, in their conflict against each other. Madena asked Jarl Skald permission to return to High Rock (where she was born and raised) until the war is over, but Skald denied her request.\r\nMadena can sometimes be seen arguing with Silus Vesuius outside Silus' house. Silus, an Imperial man, is a Mythic Dawn fanatic who takes a particular interest in Mehrunes Dagon (the Daedric prince of destruction and revolution), and has recently opened a small museum dedicated to the Mythic Dawn. Shockingly, Silus takes pride in his ancestors\u2019 involvement with Mythic Dawn cult during the Oblivion Crisis 200 years ago, despite the fact that the Mythic Dawn ended the Septim dynasty of emperors and nearly brought about the end of the world. Madena strongly disagrees with Silus\u2019 decision to open this museum. Madena may advise the player to not involve themselves with Silus and his dark obsession with evils of the past.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm here to lend my magic to the people of Dawnstar.\"\r\n\"I had hoped life would be simpler here, but war seems to find a way of following me.\"\r\n\"I'll work my spells and potions for whoever is willing to leave Dawnstar in peace.\"\r\n\"I served in the Great War as a Legion battlemage. I've no desire to go back.\"\r\n\u201cThe Jarl can make all the demands in the world, I'm not setting one foot on the battlefield. I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again.\"\r\nIf asked about the Great War: \"About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard. They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts. By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.\"\r\nIf asked about where one can learn magic: \u201cMagic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them.\"\r\nIf asked about the nightmares recently plaguing the people of Dawnstar: \"People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday. I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen.\"\r\n\"I beg you, don't go into Silus's museum.\"\r\nIf asked about Silus\u2019s museum: \u201cSilus comes from one of the oldest families in Dawnstar. They have a complicated history. Several of his ancestors belonged to the Mythic Dawn, the cult that almost destroyed Tamriel. His family's involvement was only found out well after the crisis had died down, but it still ruined their reputation. They were outcasts. And now Silus is back and this museum to the Mythic Dawn is his way of trying to rebuild his family's pride. It's misguided.\"\r\nIf asked about the Mythic Dawn: \"Not a student of history I see. It's for the best. They're a group that should be forgotten. The only thing you need to know is that they almost destroyed the world, and they were stopped. A long time ago.\"\r\n\"When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill.\"",
