    "bio": "He is a Thalmor Justiciar currently assigned to Northwatch Keep as a prisoner interrogator.\r\nNorthwatch Keep is a medium-sized stone fortress located in the remote northwestern corner of Haafingar, on a small peninsula that juts out into the icy Sea of Ghosts. This fortress serves as a detainment and interrogation center for the Thalmor's prisoners. These prisoners are primarily Talos-worshipers and Stormcloak rebels, along with a few other criminals. Access to the fort's interior is off-limits to everyone except those aligned with the Thalmor and Aldmeri Dominion. Most of the fort's personnel are common Dominion/Thalmor soldiers wearing gleaming light armor, who are subordinate to this Justiciar and the few other Thalmor mages assigned to this fortress.\r\nThe Thalmor is the governing body of the Aldmeri Dominion. A militarist regime founded on beliefs of elven racial supremacy, the Thalmor seek to advance their power and influence across Tamriel, with the specific intent of establishing the racial superiority of mer (elves) over man. Recently, the Thalmor has established a significant presence in Skyrim's Haafingar hold, including an embassy in the mountains overlooking Solitude (Skyrim's capital city), a small headquarters within Castle Dour in Solitude itself, and Northwatch Keep. In keeping with the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, the Thalmor reserves the right to maintain such a presence in Skyrim and other provinces ruled by the Empire, in order to ensure that heretical Talos worship is properly curtailed. Thalmor Justiciars can be sometimes be found traveling the roads of Skyrim, often en route to Northwatch Keep with a new prisoner in tow. Justiciars are the official enforcers of the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, specifically enforcing the ban on the worship of Talos.\r\nLike most who serve the Thalmor, he is an Altmer from the Summerset Isles. He wears dark hooded Thalmor robes, boots, and gloves, and carries a dagger. He is a powerful mage who knows a multitude of spells. He specializes in Destruction magic and Conjuration magic - in combat, he casts Thunderbolts and Fireballs while having backup from his conjured atronach (likely a storm atronach).\r\nHe spends much of his time in the torture room deep within the fort's stony interior, interrogating prisoners in order to acquire information regarding the whereabouts of additional Talos-worshiping criminals. His interrogation methods are brutal, and prisoners often die during the process.",
