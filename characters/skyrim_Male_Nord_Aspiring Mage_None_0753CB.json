    "bio": "Aspiring Mage is a Nord man who is encountered on the roads of Skyrim.\r\nWhen dialogue is started, the Aspiring Mage will say that he is \"focusing his magicka\". While not equipped, it is obvious that the Aspiring Mage has a staff. The staff can be acquired through persuasion, intimidation, or bribery, in which case he will hand it over, commenting that the staff's magic has been used up and that it is now just a dumb wooden stick, anyway.\r\nThe staff may be a Staff of Reanimation, a Staff of Zombies, a Staff of Dread Zombies, or a Staff of Revenants, all of which hold a necromancy spell. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cOh... hello there. Didn't notice you come up. I was focusing my magicka. Or at least, I thought I was. I don't really know what I'm doing.\"\r\n\"See, my grandfather was a wizard. My father wouldn't talk about him much. But I found some of his things in the attic. Including this staff. After that I thought I was turning into a wizard too, because dead things near me would come to life again for a while. I even went to the College of Winterhold. But they just laughed at me. The magic is in the staff, not in me they said.\"\r\n\"Gah! This staff is useless... I'm useless. The whole world is useless!\"",
