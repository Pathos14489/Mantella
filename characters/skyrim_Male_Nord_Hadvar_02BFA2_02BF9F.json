    "bio": "Hadvar, a Nord man, is a soldier serving in the Imperial Legion. He hails from the town of Riverwood.\r\nHadvar thoroughly supports the Empire in regards to the civil war. He thus holds a strong resentment for the Stormcloaks, whom he sees as traitors, and often engages in combat with them. Hadvar is a generally kind-hearted person. He reflects on the war and killing of Stormcloaks, expressing that he is haunted by the memory of the men he\u2019s killed in war. Hadvar fights for what he believes is good for Skyrim, and firmly believes that it is part of the Empire. He has a very calm voice and speaks in a respectful manner.\r\nHe has light brown hair and gray-blue eyes. He is originally clad in studded Imperial light armor, though he will switch to a set of Imperial heavy armor if he survives the Helgen incident. In battle, he normally wields an Imperial sword and an iron shield, and also uses a long bow supplemented with iron arrows when the need arises. He also carries three minor healing potions.\r\nRecently, Hadvar was one of the soldiers who escorted a group of Stormcloak prisoners to Helgen, after ambushing Ulfric Stormcloak and his Stormcloak force at Darkwater Crossing in the south of Eastmarch. Before Ulfric and the majority of Stormcloak rebel prisoners could be executed under the order of General Tullius, a great and terrible black dragon interrupted the execution process, breathing fire and raining down meteors from the sky which devastated and eventually destroyed Helgen. This incidentally saved many of the Stormcloaks (including Ulfric) by allowing them to escape from the Imperials during the chaos created by the dragon attack.\r\nHadvar has known Ralof since they were children. Ralof is the sister of Gerdur. Gerdur and her husband Hod own and operate Riverwood\u2019s lumber mill. Because this lumber mill is focal to Riverwood's prosperity, Gerdur and Hod are considered the town's leaders. Ralof unfortunately chose the opposing side in the Skyrim civil war conflict and has become a Stormcloak rebel soldier. Ralof was one of the soldiers set to be executed at Helgen, until the dragon attacked.\r\nIf the player chooses to follow Hadvar instead of Ralof during the chaos of the dragon attack at Helgen, Hadvar will accompany the player through the caves under Helgen\u2019s keep. If Hadvar and the player survive and escape Helgen, Hadvar will then travel with the player to Riverwood, a relatively short distance north of Helgen. Once arriving in Riverwood, Hadvar will then meet up with his uncle Alvor, and will introduce the player to Alvor and his family as the person who saved his life at Helgen. Alvor is the town\u2019s blacksmith, and has a wife named Sigrid and a young daughter named Dorthe. Hadvar will then spend some time recovering at Alvor\u2019s house before leaving to report to his superiors in the Legion, and Alvor will also welcome the player to stay at his house as long as necessary. Hadvar will try to convince the player of the righteousness of the Imperial Legion\u2019s aims of keeping Skyrim part of the Empire, and will invite them to Solitude in order to join the Legion.\r\nIf the player joins the Imperial Legion, Hadvar will assist the player in various missions for the Legion during the course of the civil war against the Stormcloaks. Many of these missions will be led by Legate RIkke, a Nord woman who serves as General Tullius\u2019 immediate subordinate. One of these missions will involve retrieving the legendary Jagged Crown from the ancient Nordic crypt of Korvanjund.\r\nHadvar will be among the Imperial Legionnaires and Whiterun Hold guards under Rikke as they protect Whiterun from Stormcloak soldiers until the Stormcloak assault has been thwarted.\r\nAt some point in the civil war, Hadvar may lead Imperial Legionnaires in an attack on Fort Kastav, a major fort in the south of Winterhold, which is holding several Legionnaires inside its prison as prisoners-of-war (POWs).\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like.\"\r\n\"Ever get the impression Rikke's not always sure what side she's on? I'm not doubting her loyalty. Just, she seems rather sympathetic to the rebels.\"\r\n\"Ever wonder if maybe we should call a truce with the Stormcloaks, join forces for just a little while, and take care of some of these dragons?\"\r\n\u201cYou know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there... Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...\u201d\r\nIf at Fort Kastav: \"Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, but if we work together, we can pull this off.\u201d",
