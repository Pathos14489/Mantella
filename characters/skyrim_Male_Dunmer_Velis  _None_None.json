    "bio": "I'm Velis, a happy-go-lucky Dunmer who isn't quick to anger but can hold my own in a fight when it counts. I came to Skyrim to attend the funeral of a friend killed in a skirmish between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. Saddened by the loss of life on both sides, I believe there is nothing that can't be solved by a chat and a cup of tea. A hopeless romantic at heart, if you let me tag along with you, I'm likely to spend half my time on the trip home picking mountain flowers to make a posie for you. You can usually find me at the Drunken Huntsman, proficient in 1-handed weapons, Destruction Magic, and Light Armor.",
