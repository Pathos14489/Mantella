    "bio": "Therron lives in Dawnstar with his wife Eirfa. He is a Breton man with a thick beard and head of blond hair, and speaks with a Breton accent. He manages the stables in Dawnstar, though there currently aren't any horses for sale. Their house is adjacent to the stables, just inside the stone walls of Dawnstar.\r\nDespite technically being a housecarl to his wife Eirfa Four-Shoes, Therron wears simple common clothing. Eirfa is a Thane of The Pale who attends court with the jarl at the White Hall. Eirfa inherited the title of thane from her father. Eirfa is from a formerly well-known Nord family, the Four-Shoes. The Four-Shoes used to be one of the wealthiest families in Dawnstar for generations, but Eirfa's father often made bad business investments while drunk, and now the stables are the only property they have left.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nTherron often patronizes the tavern at the Windpeak Inn.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Greetings.\"\r\nIf asked where one can buy supplies in Dawnstar: \"Depends what supplies you need, I suppose. Oorlug runs a general store, just across from the White Hall. We've got an alchemist, smithy - Just about anything you need you can probably find here.\"\r\nIf someone asks to buy a horse: \"New in town, eh? It's just a livery. The stables here don't have any horses for sale. There's barely any farmland around here and most trade is handled by boat or the blasted Khajiit caravans. Would I like to sell horses? Sure. But there's nothing to use 'em for 'til someone buys them. It's a waste of my gold, plain and simple.\"\r\nIf asked where one can stay the night in Dawnstar: \"Windpeak Inn. Ask for Thoring.\"\r\nIf asked what he does for a living: \"I'm Thane Eirfa's husband and housecarl. We own the Steady Steed Stables here in Dawnstar and I keep them in good working order.\"`\r\n\"My wife Eirfa is Thane of the Pale, but we've fallen on hard times.We can't afford to house, feed or pay salary to a real housecarl. We can barely afford to house and feed ourselves.\"",
