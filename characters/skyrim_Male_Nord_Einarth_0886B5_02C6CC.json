Although Arngeir says that the Greybeard's leader, Paarthurnax, knows of such a shout, he refuses to allow the Dragonborn to speak with him. Einarth, however, convinces Arngeir to allow the Dragonborn to travel to the Throat of the World to meet Paarthurnax.\r\n\r\nEinarth is present for the peace council at High Hrothgar between the Stormcloaks and the Empire. He stands by the wall of the meeting chamber like the other Greybeards, except for Arngeir who chairs the council.",
