    "bio": "Hroar is a Nord orphan living in the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften, as one of the victims of the cruelty of the disastrously misnamed headmistress, Grelod the Kind.\r\nHroar claims his name was inspired by the roar of a lion. Although he has never seen a lion, he claims that his late mother told him this was the case. He goes on to say that\u00a0he wants to be big and strong like a lion, when he grows up. He regrets that neither Grelod nor Constance Michel will allow him to be adopted, claiming, \"I'd be the best son ever.\"\r\nUnlike most of the other adoptable children, he\u00a0does not mention how he lost his parents. He is one of the children who can be adopted by the Dragonborn.",
