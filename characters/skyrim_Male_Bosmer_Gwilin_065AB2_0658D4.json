By day he can be found chopping wood near the Vilemyr Inn, the place where he sleeps at night.\r\nGwilin: \"On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?\" Klimmek: \"Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.\" Gwilin: \"Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?\" Klimmek: \"Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day.\"",
