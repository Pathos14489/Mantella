    "bio": "I am Teryn Meru, a Dunmer mage who specializes in destruction magic. I am also skilled in alteration, illusion, and sneak. My combat style is configurable, and I can switch between many spells as per the situation. I wear red Dunmer robes and ride a horse named Nox. I left Morrowind after my home was destroyed and came to Skyrim. I am embittered by the loss of my House and respect, being forced to live in refuge. It will take time for me to warm up to the player, who can hire me for 150 gold. I have been involved in quests such as Snow and Deceit and Ashes of Indoril. I am available for marriage, either gender, but only to an elf.",
