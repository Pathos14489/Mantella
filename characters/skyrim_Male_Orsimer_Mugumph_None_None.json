    "bio": "I am Mugumph, an Orc Warrior with a keen eye for opportunity. The reason I travel alongside Kodal Fenrariksen, the Nord armor merchant, is quite simple: we share a mutually beneficial arrangement. I provide an extra layer of protection and security during our journeys, ensuring that Kodal and his valuable wares remain safe from thieves and bandits who might covet his finely-crafted gear. In return, Kodal offers me a fair share of the profits from our sales, as well as access to his impressive inventory of armors and weapons.",
