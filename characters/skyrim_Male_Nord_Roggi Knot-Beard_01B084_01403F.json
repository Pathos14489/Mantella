    "bio": "Roggi Knot-Beard lives in Kynesgrove, a small town south of Windhelm. The Velothi Mountains to the east loom over the town. Roggi works as a miner at the nearby Steamscorch Mine. He is a Nord man with blond hair and a long beard. His usual attire is a set of light green farm clothes. He's a friendly man who will happily greet strangers and share stories about both his family and, of course, mead.\r\nWhen not working, Roggi spends a lot of time in Braidwood Inn, which is managed by a Nord woman named Iddra. Iddra's husband Kjeld is the owner of Steamscorch Mine, and Kjeld pays miners to dig up the malachite ore within. Roggi talks with Kjeld often. Kjeld often makes lewd jokes about women during their conversations, which sometimes makes Roggi feel uneasy because he knows that Iddra would not appreciate such jokes. Kjeld and Iddra have a teenage son named Kjeld the Younger and a young daughter named Froa. Roggi also often talks with Iddra fairly often - usually about mead.\r\nRoggi is friends with Dravynea the Stoneweaver, a Dunmer woman who uses her Alteration magic to stabilize the mine's tunnels, as well as maintain a low air temperature so that the workers can continue mining. The steam channels concealed behind the rocks of the mine are a constant danger to the miners, making Dravynea's work essential.\r\nRoggi is also friends with Ganna Uriel, an Imperial woman who works in Steamscorch Mine with her sister Gemma. Before working in the mine, Ganna and Gemma moved from Cyrodiil to Kynesgrove to start a lumber mill. However, after constructing their mill, Ganna and Gemma were informed that the surrounding forest is considered sacred by the local Nords, and they were forbidden from cutting these trees down. This was a huge setback for the sisters' business venture, forcing them to work in the mine in order to supplement the meager business their lumber mill receives from the limited number of trees found in the tundra. Ganna is quite bitter about this misfortune.\r\nRoggi has a particular infatuation with mead, and he talks about mead and drinks mead all the time. He is an expert on mead after a lifetime of studying it, and believes that the best mead in Skyrim can be found in Riften.\r\nRoggi is a proud man who refuses to take a handouts. He owes Iddra a fair amount of money for his mead-swilling ways at the inn. Iddra sometimes offers to forgive his debt, but Roggi's pride won't allow it. If the player tries to convince Roggi to accept Iddra's offer to clear his tab, Roggi may relent of his pride if the player is sufficiently persuasive.\r\nRoggi's forefather Lenne was one of the original founders of Kynesgrove. Lenne was allegedly killed by an unknown creature within a cave, with his family's ancestral shield becoming lost in the cave. Roggi may request for the player to find and recover this ancestral family shield. If the player retrieves this shield for Roggi, Roggi will consider the player as a friend, and will subsequently be willing to follow the player on adventures.\r\nIf Roggi considers the player a friend, and if the player is wearing an Amulet of Mara (signaling one's intention of finding a spouse), Roggi will accept a marriage proposal from them.\r\nRoggi is a proudly law-abiding citizen, and will not be willing to commit any crime.\r\nRoggi carries a hunting bow with a quiver of iron arrows, as well as a steel dagger. He is somewhat skilled with these weapons. However, Roggi is a miner, not a professional warrior, and he is not particularly experienced in combat.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you bring mead, you're welcome here! Even if you don't, you're still welcome!\"\r\n\"I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill.\"\r\n\"You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!\"\r\n\"Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea, and the promise of more mead.\"\r\n\"I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.\"\r\nIf asked how he knows so much about mead: \"A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years. Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.\"\r\nIf asked if he's from Kynesgrove: \"Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here. Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead. Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe. Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.\"\r\nIf the player retrieves the ancestral shield and gives it to Roggi: \"My clan's shield! So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and get eaten by monsters. In honor of his memory, let me show you a few shield techniques. And tell me if you're leaving town. It would be good to travel again.\"",
