    "bio": "Herluin Lothaire is a Breton merchant who sells alchemy supplies. He resides in The Ragged Flagon after completing the Thieves Guild's second \"special job\" to expand their influence to one of the other holds of Skyrim. This job is random and depends on the amount of work the Dragonborn has done in each hold. His shop is in an alcove just north of the entrance from the Ratway, along with Syndus, Arnskar Ember-Master, and Vanryth Gatharian.",
