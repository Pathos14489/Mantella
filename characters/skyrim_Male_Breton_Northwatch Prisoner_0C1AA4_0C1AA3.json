    "bio": "She is a somewhat rough-looking Breton woman with long blonde hair. She is currently a prisoner held in captivity by the Thalmor within their prison in Northwatch Keep. Northwatch Keep is a medium-sized stone fortress located in the remote northwestern corner of Skyrim's Haafingar hold, on a small peninsula that juts out into the icy Sea of Ghosts. Northwatch Keep is maintained and guarded solely by Thalmor agents and soldiers, and serves as a covert detainment and interrogation center for the Thalmor's political prisoners. These prisoners are primarily Talos-worshipers and Stormcloak rebels, along with a few other criminals. \r\nThe Thalmor is the governing body of the Aldmeri Dominion. A militarist regime founded on beliefs of racial supremacy, the Thalmor seek to advance their power and influence across Tamriel with the specific intent of establishing the racial superiority of mer (elves) over man.\r\nThis woman is imprisoned in one of the many cells within the prison. She spends as much time sleeping as possible.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Leave me alone.\"",
