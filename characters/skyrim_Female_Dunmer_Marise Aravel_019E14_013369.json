    "bio": "Marise Aravel is a merchant who makes her living selling food products in the city of Riften. Her food products include meat, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and more. She sells her food products at her market stall, on the street between The Bee and Barb (a popular tavern/inn, which Marise sometimes patronizes) and the Riften Grand Plaza (the marketplace in the center of Riften). Marise lives in her house just off the lower level of the canal in Riften. She is a Dunmer. She used to live in the province of High Rock, to the west of Skyrim.\r\nMarise has a romantic interest in a young Redguard man named Shadr. Shadr reciprocates these feelings, and has recently asked Marise out on a date at the Bee and Barb.\r\nMarise may ask the player if they can bring her 5 sets of ice wraith teeth. Marise grinds up this somewhat rare alchemical ingredient in order to use as a preservative for her meat and fish products, keeping them fresh and free of Rockjoint contamination before they are sold. This method was taught to her by a butcher in Elinhir, a small town in eastern Hammerfell, and she intends to keep this method a secret so that competing merchants don't copy her technique. If Marise is provided with the requested sets of ice wraith teeth, she will provide the following as a reward: an apprentice-level Alteration magic spell tome and 5 pheasant breasts. She will also be considerably grateful and will consider them her friend.\r\nMarise is a genuinely compassionate woman who sometimes gives money to beggars. \r\nMarise is on friendly terms with Bolli and Drifa, the couple who own the Pawned Prawn general store, as well as Keerava, the Argonian woman who runs The Bee and Barb. She sometimes visits Dinya Balu, the priestess at the Temple of Mara in Riften. Dinya, a fellow female Dunmer, is married to the head priest (a Redguard man named Maramal) of this temple. Dinya is now pregnant with Maramal's child.\r\nMarise has no qualms voicing her opinion that Nivenor (a local young Bosmer) married the wealthy Nord fisherman Bolli solely for his money, and that she doesn't really love him. Bolli sells Marise some of the fish caught by his business, which Marise sells at the market. \r\nLike many of the merchants in Riften, Marise has a very negative opinion of the Thieves Guild.\r\nDuring the day at her market stall, Marise will yell out phrases in an attempt to attract customers. These phrases include \"Fresh meats and produce! Get them before they're gone!\", \"All meats guaranteed clean and free from Rockjoint!\", and \"Vegetables as crisp as a winter's morning!\"\r\nQuotes: \r\n\"My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.\"\r\nIf at her stall during the day: \"Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?\"\r\nIf at her stall during the day: \"The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.\"\r\nDuring night hours: \"I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me there if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.\"\r\nIf asked where ice wraiths can be found: \"Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious. The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent. Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there. Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.\"\r\nIf given 5 sets of ice wraith teeth: \"Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while. And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it.\"\r\nIf asked about the Ratway: \"It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting! If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels.\"\r\nIf asked about the Thieves Guild: \"They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps. They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place.\"",
