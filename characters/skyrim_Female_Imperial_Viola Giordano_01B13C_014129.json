    "bio": "Viola Giordano, an older Imperial woman, lives in Windhelm. She often spends her evenings at Candlehearth Hall, which is run by a woman named Elda Early-Dawn.\r\nViola worries excessively about the Butcher and his recent murders of young women in Windhelm. Viola is the author of the \"Beware the Butcher!\" flyer posted all around the city. In addition to her constant fretting, Viola also has an obsession with Captain Lonely-Gale, the retired ship captain living in the city. Viola bothers the Captain quite often, with trivial questions regarding lovers and the recent murders. Lonely-Gale's wife died a little while ago. Viola sometime tries to ask the Captain out on a date.\r\nIf the player is tasked by the Jarl's court with discovering the Butcher's identity, Viola will be happy to assist in the investigation.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about the Butcher: \"I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him. The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.\"\r\n",
