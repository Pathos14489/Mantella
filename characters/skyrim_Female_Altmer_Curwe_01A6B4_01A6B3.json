    "bio": "Curwe, an Altmer woman, works as a farmer. Curwe and her husband Vantus Loreius (an Imperial man) live together at Loreius Farm, located in a remote hilly region north of Whiterun. There is a large mammoth boneyard to west of their farm.\r\nCurwe has graying blonde hair. She wears a set of green farm clothes and a pair of boots.\r\nThe first time that Curwe and Vantus are encountered, Cicero (a strange man named with the appearance of a jester) will be on the road just south of the farm. Cicero requested the assistance of Vantus in repairing the broken wheel on his wagon, but Vantus refused. Vantus had this to say on the matter: \u201cA jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years. And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. 'Mother' my eye. He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.\"\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You need something, talk to my husband, Vantus Loreius.\u201d",
