    "bio": "Sinding, a Nord man, is imprisoned in the jail of Falkreath.\r\nHe is cursed with lycanthropy: he sporadically and randomly transforms into a werewolf, without any control of his transformations.\r\nSinding is in jail because he recently accidentally killed the young daughter of Mathies and Indara Caerellia while in werewolf form. Sinding was in Falkreath because he was looking for a giant beast called the White Stag, which roams the forests of Falkreath Hold. If Sinding was to kill this beast, the Daedric Lord Hircine would lift his curse of lycanthropy.\r\nFrom his jail cell, Sinding will give the player the Ring of Hircine, which causes the wearer to sporadically transform into a werewolf. Later, the player will have to choose between either killing Sinding in his werewolf form (in order to obtain the Savior's Hide from Hircine), or sparing Sinding and killing the other hunters of Hircine who have been sent to kill Sinding.",
