    "bio": "Vidrald is a Nord warrior and a friend of the Gray-Manes. He wears a set of random leveled heavy armor.\r\nVidrald is a friend of the Gray-Manes and in particular Avulstein Gray-Mane and Thorald Gray-Mane, whom he pledged to aid a long time ago.\r\nHe accompanies Avulstein to Northwatch Keep to help rescue Thorald, but only if the Dragonborn lets Avulstein tag along. If Vidrald survives rescuing Thorald from the Thalmor, he will remain at the Keep with Geirlund, and can usually be found either in the courtyard, or in the prison area protecting the Thalmor's other prisoners.",
