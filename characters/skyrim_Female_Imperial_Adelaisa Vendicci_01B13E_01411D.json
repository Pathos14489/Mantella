    "bio": "Adelaisa Vendicci works for the East Empire Company. She is a middle-aged Imperial woman, a veteran of the Imperial Legion. She has white hair, and typically wears a set of Imperial heavy armor. In combat, she will rely on her Imperial sword.\r\nAdelaisa can often be found inside the East Empire Company office near the docks of Windhelm, talking to Orthus Endario. Orthus is an Imperial man who works as the East Empire Company's regional manager in Windhelm. Orthus hasn't been doing the best job of making sure that the East Empire Company's shipments are protected against pirate raids, and Adelaisa has been sent by the company to Windhelm in order to investigate and fix this problem. In addition to disrupting the trade in Windhelm, the company's even larger business operation in Solitude has also been negatively affected by the pirates.\r\nThe East Empire Company, also known as the East Empire Trading Company or simply \"the Company\", is an Imperial merchant organization. The Company has a monopoly on multiple trade goods across Tamriel, with offices all over the continent. The Company was originally commissioned hundreds of years ago in the Third Era by the Emperor of the time, and is controlled by a group of individuals that the Emperor appoints. The Company is quite wealthy and powerful. Employees of the Company are expected to have a winning personality, and a strong will. Those with the ability to speak eloquently and barter shrewdly are the most valuable. Given the hostile environments that the Company often ventures into, employees often have a keen sense of security.\r\nIf the player discovers the location of the base of operations for the Blood Horker pirate group, Adelaisa and a contigent of East Empire Company employees will accompany the player to pirates' base, where Adelaisa will ask the player to defeat the leader of the Blood Horkers. If the pirates\u2019 leader is killed, Adelaisa and her contingent will then sail back to Windhelm with the player.\r\nIf Haldyn and the Blood Horkers have been defeated, Adelaisa will be grateful, and consider the player to be their friend. Adelaisa will subsequently be willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. Despite her well-armored appearance and involvement with taking down large pirate groups, Adelaisa is actually most skilled in the professions of Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing, and is not particularly skilled in actual combat. She is also available to hire as a stewardess of a homestead, if the player owns one.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back.\"\r\nIf the player informs her of the location of the pirate base: \"Finally, someone around here that can get things done. Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments.\"\r\nWhen preparing to attack the pirate base: \u201cThis could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.\"",
