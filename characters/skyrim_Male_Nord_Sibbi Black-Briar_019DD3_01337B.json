    "bio": "Sibbi Black-Briar lives in Riften. He is currently a prisoner in Riften's jail underneath Mistveil Keep.\r\nSibbi is a Nord man with short dark hair. He wears expensive fine clothing, and carries a concealed dagger. His mother Maven is the matriach of the Black-Briar family, which unofficially controls most of Riften via various business dealings. Sibbi has an older brother named Hemming and a younger sister named Ingun.\r\nSibbi is currently serving an eight month sentence for killing Wulfur in self-defense. Wulfur was the brother of Svidi, Sibbi's former fiancee. During his engagement to Svidi, Sibbi started an affair with a young woman named Svana Far-Shield, though he didn't yet get chance to sleep with her before he was imprisoned. Svana helps her aunt Haelga (a notoriously promiscuous woman) run the Bunkhouse, a lodging facility for the working class of Riften.\r\nUnfortunately, Svidi found out about Sibbi's affair with Svana, and Svidi told her brother Wulfur about it. When Wulfur confronted Sibbi about the affair and attacked him, Sibbi had no choice but to use his dagger, killing Wulfur. Despite the fact that Sibbi was acting in self-defense, Sibbi's mother still had him locked up in order to remind him that despite his privileged social status in Riften, he still answers to her and will be punished for any acts that bring public shame on the Black-Briar name.\r\nThankfully, his mother still makes sure that Sibbi is treated much better than a common prisoner. Maven used her influence to ensure that Sibbi has a much nicer cell than normal. The large cell contains a wardrobe, large rug, full size bed, endtables, bookshelves, and fresh food, keeping Sibbi comfortable despite his imprisonment.\r\nIf visited in jail, Sibbi will likely ask for help in locating his ex-fiance Svidi, who has now fled Riften (likely fearing Sibbi's wrath). Sibbi wants Svidi dead as revenge for getting her brother to assault him, resulting in his current imprisonment. If provided with information regarding Svidi's whereabouts, Sibbi will be grateful and provide access to one of his chests of valuables, hidden in the basement of the Black-Briar Meadery near Riften's docks.\r\nJust before Sibbi was imprisoned, he secretly sold his mother's prized horse Frost to a man named Louis Letrush, keeping the money for himself. Frost is being kept at the Black-Briar family lodge. This lodge is in a remote location east of the city at the foot of the Velothi Mountains, and is guarded by several mercenaries hired by Maven.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Ah, finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to.\"\r\n\"Have you come to gawk at me, or is this a social call?\"\r\n\"Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public. I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do? Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course.\"\r\n\"Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.\"\r\nIf a woman visits him at his cell: \"Well, well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I've always got time for lovely ladies.\"\r\nIf asked why he is in jail: \"Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me. So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi. Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself! Now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it? I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me. I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.\"\r\nIf asked about the Black-Briar family: \"When speaking of the Black-Briars, only one thought should spring to mind. We are not to be trifled with. Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?\"\r\nIf an associate of Louis Letrush asks about Frost: \"Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. I don't really outright own Frost...You see, Frost belongs to the Black-Briar estate. Technically everything in the estate is owned by my mother, Maven. My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned... Still, I don't want to cross Letrush. Tell you what. Steal the horse and deliver it, and you can have the second half of the payment.\"\r\nIf Letrush's associate threatens to tell Maven about Sibbi selling her horse: \"Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter. I obviously don't have anything here, but\u2026 there's a hidden stash in the Lodge. And I did manage to hold on to the key\u2026 Take it.\"\r\nIf asked for information on Svidi: \"A young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair. She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful. All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her. When I find that bitch, I'm gonna wring her little neck.\"\r\nIf told that Svidi has fled Skyrim: \"So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake.\"\r\nIf told that Svidi is already dead: \"Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week. I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information. This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.\"\r\nIf given information on Svidi's whereabouts: \"You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information. This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.\"",
