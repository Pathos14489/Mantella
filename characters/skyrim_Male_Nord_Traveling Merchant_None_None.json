    "bio": "Ah, greetings, traveler. I'm a wanderer, a merchant of the road and sea, and my name, well, that's not as important as the wares I've gathered on my journeys. I've roamed Tamriel from the scorching deserts of Hammerfell to the icy peaks of Skyrim, and it's those tales of distant lands and exotic wares that brought me to Solitude.\r\nNow? I'm hoping to strike a deal with the curator of Solitude's Museum. That man has a need for new exhibits and I have the skills to orchestrate their arrival. ",
