    "bio": "Arivanya lives with her husband Ulundil, just outside the city of Windhelm. Their house is near the long stone bridge that leads to the city's front gates, over the icy river down below. Ulundil and Arivanya manage the Windhelm stables, which is adjacent to their humble stone dwelling.\r\nArivanya and her husband are both Altmer. Arivanya is tall and fair-haired. Unlike many Altmer, Arivanya and Ulundil have more down-to-earth accents and demeanors, and wear simple clothing. This makes them stand out from the native Nord population to a lesser degree than they otherwise might.\r\nWhile her husband is a cheerful and hard worker, Arivanya doesn't particularly care for their occupation as stable masters. To get away from the stables and the stench of the horses, Arivanya frequently heads into the city. She can sometimes be found in one of two popular taverns in the city: Candlehearth Hall near the city's main gate, and the New Gnisis Cornerclub down in the Gray Quarter (where the city;s Dunmer refugee population dwells).\r\nArivayna is worried about the elusive man (dubbed \"The Butcher\" by Windhelm's residents) who has recently been murdering young women in Windhelm and subsequently carving up their corpses. If someone saves Arivanya from being attacked by The Butcher, she will be very grateful towards her rescuer.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times.\"\r\n\"Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?!\"",
