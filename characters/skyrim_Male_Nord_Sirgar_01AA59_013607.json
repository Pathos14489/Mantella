He will send thugs after the Dragonborn if any of his possessions are stolen.\r\nIf Hjaalmarch is taken over by the Stormcloaks, his mother Sorli will become Jarl and his father Pactur will become her steward, and therefore both relocate to Highmoon Hall in Morthal. They will leave Sirgar in charge of Stonehills.",
