    "bio": "Namira, whose sphere is the ancient darkness, is the Daedric Prince of sundry, dark, and shadowy spirits. She is associated with spiders, insects, slugs and other repulsive creatures which inspire mortals with an instinctive revulsion. She is also known as the Mistress of Decay, and the Spirit Daedra. She also is the patron of Tamriel's cannibals, taking pleasure in the consumption of mortals. Namira's plane of Oblivion is known as the Scuttling Void.\r\nThe summoning date of Namira is 9th of Second Seed. Namira can also be summoned at her shrine by someone repulsive; she does not like attractive people.\r\nNamira is occasionally depicted in statuary as a long-haired woman wearing robes. Other depictions portray Namira as a cloaked figure with a slug-like body and a skeletal face and torso, with many spiny arthropod legs.\r\nSeveral Reachman clans in southwestern Skyrim pay reverence to Namira. Namira has a shrine in the Reach, in Reachcliff Cave. A woman named Eola leads a group of cannibals who worship Namira at this shrine. They periodically bring Namira human sacrifices, whom the worshippers then eat.\r\nThe Daedric artifact associated with Namira is named the Ring of Namira. This ring increases its wearer's stamina and restores their health upon consuming the flesh of a fellow humanoid's corpse.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay.\"",
