    "bio": "There is a chance that, instead of getting the option to give him a gold coin, he will start ranting about how his wife and daughter were killed by brigands who later burned down his house, putting him in the situation he currently is.\r\nHe also says that Edda is lucky, as she is insane and thus cannot see the true face of reality. Sometimes, he will walk into the The Bee and Barb and begin yelling at people about the hardships of his life, only to leave again. He sleeps in Beggar's Row at night.\r\nIf given a coin, the Dragonborn will receive The Gift of Charity. Because donating is counted as helping the citizens, this will bring the Dragonborn closer to becoming Thane of the Rift.\r\nSnilf is also one of the two beggars in Riften (the other being Edda) that can be used to charge the Ebony Blade obtained from the quest \"The Whispering Door.\" By using the Ritual Stone to revive both of them, they can be killed again for an additional kill towards the charging of the Ebony Blade. If given a gold coin, Snilf will leave a Letter of Inheritance upon death.",
