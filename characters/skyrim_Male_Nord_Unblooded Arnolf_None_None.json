    "bio": "I am Arnolf. I reckon it's been no more than a week since I hitched my fate to the Stormcloaks. I'm a farmer from Rorikstead, tending to the land like my folks did before me. But when them Imperial tax collectors came around, squeezing every last septim outta us after their deal with the Thalmor, I knew somethin' had to change. I joined the Stormcloaks because I couldn't stand seeing the Empire stomp all over our traditions and spit on our gods. Talos, bless his soul, deserved better than to be outlawed. Ulfric, he's a Nord true and true, and he's got the fire in his heart to stand up to the Empire. So I grabbed my dad's old axe and signed up. About me? I got a deep connection with the land. I can make crops grow in the harshest winters, and my farm animals, they always seem to trust me. ",
