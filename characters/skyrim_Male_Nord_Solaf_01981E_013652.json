He has a younger brother named Bolund.\r\nShould the Dragonborn happen to kill Narri, they will later receive a letter from Solaf, stating that he knows that they have killed them, and wants to thank them for it. If talked to after receiving the letter, one will find out she was his rival, and that he wishes never to speak of it again.\r\nSolaf: \"Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put.\" Bolund: \"Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!\"",
