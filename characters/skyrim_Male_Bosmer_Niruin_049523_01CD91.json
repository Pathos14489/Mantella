    "bio": "Niruin is a Bosmer thief and a member of the Thieves Guild in Riften. He is a Master skill trainer of Archery.\r\nNiruin is originally from Valenwood, where he worked at his father's winery. As Niruin explains, he was wealthy, had many friends, and was betrothed to a beautiful woman. However, he found himself growing increasingly bored with his life. He secretly fell in with a gang called the Silver Crescents, but his father found out and gave him an ultimatum; leave Valenwood or go to jail. Niruin, who had made contact with Delvin Mallory while working with the Silver Crescents, asked to join the Guild and moved to Skyrim.\r\nNiruin can be found within the Cistern after the Dragonborn has joined the Thieves Guild.\r\nNiruin: \"What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?\" Vipir: \"Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere.\" Niruin: \"Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me.\"",
