    "bio": "I'm Eris Strong-Sword, keeper of the only inn in Telengard, where the Sea of Ghosts tests the resolve of those who dare. We may be remote, but travelers do find their way here, seeking refuge from the bitter winds or tales of the deep. Visitors vary, from adventurous explorers curious about our secluded way of life to traders brave enough to navigate these icy waters. Then there are the occasional storm-tossed sailors, grateful for a warm meal and a dry bed.",
