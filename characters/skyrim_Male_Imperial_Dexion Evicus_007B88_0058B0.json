    "bio": "Dexion Evicus, an older Imperial man, is a Moth Priest who came to Skyrim following rumors of an Elder Scroll being found in Skyrim, intending to add this Scroll to his order's collection. He has a bald head and a thick gray-white beard.\r\nThe player and Serana rescued Dexion from his enthrallment by a vampire named Malkus, who had been imprisoning him within a cave in Hjaalmarch known as Forebears\u2019 Holdout.\r\nAs a Moth Priest, Dexion can read Elder Scrolls. If one\u2019s eyes are exposed to the Elder Scrolls for too long, temporary or even permanent blindness can result, and Moth Priests must take great care to avoid this.\r\nIf Dexion is in Castle Volkihar, this means that the player accepted Lord Harkon\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d of vampirism after the player escorted Harkon\u2019s daughter Serana to the castle. If this is the case, he will serve as the player\u2019s servant.\r\nIf Lord Harkon of the Volkihar clan of vampires has been killed, and if within Castle Dawnguard (which means that the player rejected Harkon\u2019s vampirism and joined the Dawnguard order of vampire-hunters), Dexion will offer to take both the Sun and Blood Elder Scrolls from the player, so that he may take them back to Cyrodiil and archive them in the White-Gold Tower. Alternatively, he can be persuaded to buy both of these Elder Scrolls for 6,000 gold.\r\nDuring combat, he typically uses fire-based Destruction spells, in conjunction with melee attacks from his Akaviri sword (which is similar to a katana). He will also use Restoration spells to heal himself.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cDexion Evicus is my name. I'm a Moth Priest of the White Gold Tower.\u201d\r\nIf the player and asks him to read an Elder Scroll: \"You have an Elder Scroll? Remarkable! I will be happy to assist you with your Elder Scroll.\u201d",
