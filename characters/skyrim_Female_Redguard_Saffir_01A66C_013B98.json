    "bio": "Saffir is a Redguard woman who lives in Whiterun with her family.\r\nSaffir is the wife of Amren and the mother of Braith. She has no social options, but does assist in the initiation of the quest \"Amren's Sword.\"\r\nBesides her argument with Amren, she almost always stays inside telling the Dragonborn about her obsession with books.\r\nSaffir: \"I know your family's honor is important to you, but we can't afford it!\" Amren: \"It took me weeks to find that thieves' den. I can't stop now, and I can't get the sword on my own.\" Saffir: \"So you're willing to starve your wife and daughter to reclaim some rusty old sword?\" Saffir: \"I'll put it plainly. You can claim your sword, or you can keep your wife. If you set foot outside the gate, I won't be here when you return.\"",
