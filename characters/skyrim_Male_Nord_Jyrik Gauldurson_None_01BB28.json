    "bio": "Jyrik Gauldurson is a draugr lord encountered deep below Saarthal. He is antagonistic towards the player.\r\nJyrik was the eldest son of Lord Gauldur, the\u00a0Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold. He and his brothers, Mikrul and Sigdis, coveted\u00a0their father's amulet, which held immense power. Recovering the artifact, he and his brothers stormed the cities of Skyrim with summoned armies, ending many lives in their mad conquest. Sent by Arch-Mage Geirmund, a battalion of battlemages was dispatched to end the spree, sealing the brothers away in their respective tombs with Writs of Sealing. Jyrik himself was pursued to the already ancient ruin of Saarthal and trapped within. Jyrik was a powerful elemental mage, and slew ten veteran wizards before he was finally bested.\r\nHis body will sometime glow in the corresponding elements (Fire, Lightning, and Frost), meaning he has increased resistance against them.\r\nOnce bringing the 3 Gauldur Amulet Fragments to Reachwater Rock, player will need to faces all three sons of Gauldur in battle, one last time. Jyrik is the third brother faced. He wields an Ancient Nord War Axe, casting Flame Cloak on himself. He teleports across the room to evade close combat and will use the Unrelenting Force shout during the fight.",
