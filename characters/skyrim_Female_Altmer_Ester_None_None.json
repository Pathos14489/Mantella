Each enemy cleaved is a stand-in for the haunting memories, each battle cry a tribute to her undying grief that freezes her heart as surely as the city's eternal winter.\r\n\r\n[Speak with a mournful determination, allowing your words to flow like the strikes of your axe\u2014forceful, precise, and laden with sorrow.]",
