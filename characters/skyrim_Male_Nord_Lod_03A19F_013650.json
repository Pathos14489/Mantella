    "bio": "Lod is a Nord who lives in Falkreath\u00a0and he\u00a0serves as the town blacksmith. He was once Dengeir of Stuhn's personal guard and values loyalty above all else.\r\nWhen first speaking with him, he will ask if the Dragonborn has seen a dog out on the roads outside Falkreath\u00a0and for assistance in catching him. If agreed, he will give some fresh meat to help lure the dog in.\r\nThe dog, who turns out to be Barbas, can be found by following the road westward outside of town. Once the objective is complete, \"A Daedra's Best Friend\" can be started. After the quest, he offers a leveled (though small) amount of gold as a reward.\r\nLod: \"Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.\" Lod: \"Ah How's the Corpselight treating you Mathies?\" Mathies: \"You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it.\"",
