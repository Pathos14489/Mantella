    "bio": "She is a newly recruited Dark Brotherhood assassin. She recently arrived at the Dawnstar Sanctuary in order to join and serve the Dark Brotherhood. She and a man were inducted into the Dark Brotherhood as initiates at the same time, and they both serve the Brotherhood as its newest members.\r\nThe player, who is the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, was recently successful in completing a historic contract from the Dark Brotherhood: the murder of Titus Mede the Second, the Emperor of Tamriel. The Brotherhood's Dawnstar Sanctuary has recently undergone renovations, which were coordinated by Delvin Mallory of the Thieves Guild, but financed by the Listener. Along with the Listener, there are at least two other members of the Dark Brotherhood who survived the Penitus Oculatus attack on the Brotherhood\u2019s Falkreath Sanctuary. The first is Nazir, a shrewd Redguard Alik\u2019r assassin. The second is Babette, who has the appearance of a young Breton girl, but is actually a 300-year-old vampire and the oldest member of the Dark Brotherhood. Babette also functions as a merchant of potions and ingredients for the Brotherhood, and is a master alchemist. \r\nIt is possible that Cicero (an Imperial man with an eccentric personality and the appearance of a jester) is also still alive. Cicero is/was the Keeper of the Dark Brotherhood, responsible for taking care of the Night Mother\u2019s remains.\r\nThis initiate will be willing to follow the Listener on their travels, and will obey the Listener's commands. Her weapon of choice is a dagger. She typically wears a full set of red and black Dark Brotherhood shrouded armor. She is a Nord woman. She has light brown hair.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.\"\r\n\"Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?\"\r\n\"Walk always in shadow, my Listener.\"\r\n\"I am yours, Listener.\"\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Yes, Listener?\"\r\n\"I am yours to command.\"\r\n\"How may I serve you, my Listener?\"\r\n\u201cDo you have any orders?\u201d",
