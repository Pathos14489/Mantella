    "bio": "Hod, a Nord man, is a lumberjack who lives in the town of Riverwood. He and his wife Gerdur own and operate Riverwood's lumber mill. They have a young son named Frodnar.\r\nHod has blue eyes and blond hair, and has a thick mustache. He usually wears a white set of clothes and a pair of boots.\r\nHod\u2019s brother-in-law is Ralof, Gerdur\u2019s younger brother. Ralof serves as a soldier with the Stormcloaks.\r\nHod and his son Frodnar often spend quality time together. Hod often asks Frodnar about any recent pranks has performed, and encourages Frodnar to keep making his mark on the world.\r\nRiverwood is located at the southeastern tip of Whiterun Hold, just north of the boundary between Whiterun Hold and Falkreath Hold. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills (a small mountain range that divides Whiterun Hold to the north from Falkreath Hold to the south), stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. Hod and Gerdur\u2019s house is on the east edge of the town. The Riverwood Trader general store, which is run by Imperial immigrants Lucan Valerius and his younger sister Camilla Valerius, is nearby on the town\u2019s main road. The Sleeping Giant Inn is also not far from their house, and is owned by a Breton woman named Delphine, and mostly run by a Nord man named Orgnar. Hod and Gerdur have a cow and chickens within the fence surrounding their stone and wood house.\r\nThe lumber mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, which is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges. The mill often requires the maintenance services of Alvor, the town\u2019s blacksmith. Alvor\u2019s house and adjacent smithy are located at the east bank of the river, near the mill. Alvor has a wife named Sigrid and a young daughter named Dorthe, who often plays with Frodnar. Alvor and his family support the Empire, while Hod and Gerdur\u2019s family support the Stormcloak rebellion for Skyrim's independence from the Empire. Despite the two families having opposing stances on the civil war, they still generally get along and respect each other as fellow Nords. Alvor just requested a large order of hardwood planks from Hod, to be used in making shields.\r\nHod often visits the Sleeping Giant Inn during the evening for drinks. A man named Embry is Riverwood\u2019s town drunk. Embry often asks Hod to buy him a drink when he sees him in the Sleeping Giant Inn.\r\nHod may remark about the attractiveness of a beautiful young woman named Camilla Valerius. Camilla is being pursued by two young men in Riverwood: a Nord bard named Sven, and a Wood Elf woodcutter and hunter named Faendal. If the player is a woman, Hod may also compliment the player\u2019s attractiveness.\r\nGerdur\u2019s ancestors originally founded Riverwood, and have lived there for many generations. Because of this, as well as because of the mill\u2019s importance to the town, Gerdur is the de facto leader of Riverwood. Gerdur pays the taxes, and the land of the town is owned by Jarl Balgruuf.\r\nGerdur and Hod sell their lumber for construction and other uses (such as the war), and can arrange for the lumber to be hauled to a customer\u2019s destination of choice. Each stack of 20 logs costs 200 gold. Hod will let a customer saw their own timber in the lumber mill if he has a high amount of respect for them.\r\nIf the player significantly helps his brother-in-law Ralof, Hod will consider the player his friend.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Got business here in Riverwood, eh? There are worse villages.\"\r\n\"At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.\"\r\n\"We work hard, try to do right by our families.\"\r\n\"Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need.\"\r\n\"Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.\"\r\n\"You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. Hehe.\u201d\r\nIf the player is a woman: \u201cNow you, lass\u2026 you've got some beautiful trunks yourself\u2026\u201d",
