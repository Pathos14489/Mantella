Eriana and several other Hunters of Hircine have been sent to Bloated Man's Grotto, which is located in the mountains at the northern edge of Falkreath Hold. She wears leather armor, with hide bracers and boots.\r\n She uses a sword and shield for melee combat, and a bow for ranged combat.\r\nThe Hunters of Hircine are composed of men and women of many different races and backgrounds. Eriana and several other Hunters of Hircine have been sent by Lord Hircine to kill the werewolf Sinding, in order to send Sinding's soul to the Hunting Grounds. The Hunting Grounds is the afterlife destination associated with Hircine, and is where all werewolves and followers of Hircine are sent after their death. If the player expresses the intention to attack and kill Sinding, Eriana will help the player and will be friendly with the player after Sinding is killed. If the player indicates that they intend to help Sinding escape the hunters, Eriana will become offended and hostile to the player.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Greetings, fellow hunter.\"",
