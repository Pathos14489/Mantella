    "bio": "Huki Seven-Swords is an unused character residing in the Windhelm Pit, a location accessible only through the use of console commands.\r\nHuki is the Pit's jailkeeper. She shows little respect towards those in the Pit, as is evident by her dialogue with the Dragonborn. She is a Stormcloak supporter and dislikes the Imperials.\r\nWhat do I have to do?:\u00a0\"We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight. If you win, you go free. If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of Sovngarde if you're lucky.\"\r\nI want to fight Alain Dufont. \"Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open.\"",
