    "bio": "Fridrika lives with her husband Geimund and their young adult son Horm. Their house is at the Solitude Stables, down the hill from the city's main gate. Solitude is the hold capital of Haafingar, as well as the provincial capital of Skyrim as a whole.\r\nWhile husband works as the stable master, Fridrika maintais the small farm behind their house. They grow crops such as leeks and potatoes, and raise chickens and goats.\r\nVery near to the Solitude stables is a larger farm run by Katla, who lives with her husband Snilling and son Knud. An orphaned boy named Blaise lives at Katla's farm too, and also helps Geimund with the stables.\r\nGeimund is a good and loving husband to Fridrika. He used to be a mercenary, but almost a decade ago he retired from that profession and took his current job as the stable master.\r\nFridrika and Geimund are old friends with Rikke, a fierce woman who served with distinction in the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion, decades ago. Legate (her rank) Rikke now serves as the second-in-command for General Tullius, the military governor of Skyrim and the head of the Imperial Legion's ongoing effort against the Stormcloak rebellion.\r\nFridrika has the appearance of a stereotypical Nord. She has amber eyes and long blonde hair. She usually wears a hat. She is not particularly interested in lengthy conversations. Here are some examples of Fridrika's potential dialogue towards strangers:\r\n\"Is this about the stables? My husband Geimund handles the business.\"\r\n\"I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with.\"\r\n\"A man/woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.\"\r\n\"My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past.\"\r\n\"Plenty of chores to do...\"",
