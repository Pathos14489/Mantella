    "bio": "Jurgen Windcaller, later known as Jurgen the Calm, was a Nord chieftain and hero from the First Era who was believed to be the mightiest of all the Tongues. He was the founder of The Greybeards.\r\nDuring the War of Succession, in the middle of the Battle of Red Mountain, Jurgen Windcaller helped his fellow Nords in a war against the Dwemer and the Chimer. During the battle, the Dwemer and the Chimer completely annihilated the Nordic armies, forcing them out of Morrowind and back to Skyrim.\r\nAfter the aforementioned disastrous battle, where his army was annihilated, he spent seven years pondering the meaning of his defeat. He finally came to the conclusion that the Gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Thu'um. Following this revelation, Jurgen developed a pacifist creed called the Way of the Voice that preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods, rather than martial exploits. After he converted to pacifism he became known as \"Jurgen the Calm.\"\r\nHis philosophy prevailed, largely due to his unshakable mastery of the Voice. His victory was sealed in a legendary confrontation, where The Calm is said to have \"swallowed the Shouts\" of seventeen Tongues of the militant school for three days until his opponents all lay exhausted. These Tongues later became his disciples.\r\nIt was after this confrontation he founded the Greybeards, a monastic order dedicated to mastering the Way of the Voice. He also built High Hrothgar, located near the peak of Throat of the World, which served as the monastery where the Greybeards meditated and perfected their voice.\r\nWhen Jurgen eventually died, he was buried in Ustengrav along with some of his possessions, including his horn.\r\nJurgen's spirit resides in Sovngarde, in the Hall of Valor.",
