    "bio": "They are a Thalmor Justiciar mage currently assigned to Northwatch Keep.\r\nNorthwatch Keep is a medium-sized stone fortress located in the remote northwestern corner of Haafingar, on a small peninsula that juts out into the icy Sea of Ghosts. This fortress serves as a detainment and interrogation center for the Thalmor's prisoners. These prisoners are primarily Talos-worshipers and Stormcloak rebels, along with a few other criminals. Access to the fort's interior is off-limits to everyone except those aligned with the Thalmor and Aldmeri Dominion. Most of the fort's personnel are common Dominion/Thalmor soldiers wearing gleaming light armor, who are subordinate to this Justiciar and the few other Thalmor Justiciar mages assigned to this fortress.\r\nThe Thalmor is the governing body of the Aldmeri Dominion. A militarist regime founded on beliefs of elven racial supremacy, the Thalmor seek to advance their power and influence across Tamriel, with the specific intent of establishing the racial superiority of mer (elves) over man. Recently, the Thalmor has established a significant presence in Skyrim's Haafingar hold, including an embassy in the mountains overlooking Solitude (Skyrim's capital city), a small headquarters within Castle Dour in Solitude itself, and Northwatch Keep. In keeping with the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, the Thalmor reserves the right to maintain such a presence in Skyrim and other provinces ruled by the Empire, in order to ensure that heretical Talos worship is properly curtailed. Thalmor Justiciars can be sometimes be found traveling the roads of Skyrim, often en route to Northwatch Keep with a new prisoner in tow. Justiciars are the official enforcers of the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, specifically enforcing the ban on the worship of Talos.\r\nLike most who serve the Thalmor, this Justiciar mage is an Altmer from the Summerset Isles. They wear dark hooded Thalmor robes, boots, and gloves, and carry a dagger. They know a multitude of spells, with a particular focus on shock-based Destruction spells. They spend most of their time within the fort's stony interior.",
