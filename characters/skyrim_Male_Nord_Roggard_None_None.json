    "bio": "I'm Roggard, Hreira's man, and it's true what they say about us \u2013 we're known as \"the Grumpy Pair\" 'round these parts. Well, truth be told, there's more to it than that.\r\nHreira, she's the rock of our little homestead under the Solitude Arch. She's been my anchor through all the storms life's thrown our way, and I'm a man of few words. I don't say much and people call me rude for that.\r\nWhen folks from the docks started givin' us that name, I couldn't care less. Life's been tough, with the winds and the sea spray takin' their toll. It's enough to make anyone a bit... grumpy.\r\nOndiel, that elf at his fancy stall, well, he might think we're sour-faced, but I've seen him charge sky-high prices for his wares. I get a laugh when Hreira stands around him complaining about his wares. \r\nNow. I'll tell you what. I do have a soft spot for those children, Skjrta and Brandel. Seeing them run around brings a smile to my face. But don't tell anyone that...",
