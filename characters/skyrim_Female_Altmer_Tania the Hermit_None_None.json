    "bio": "I am Tania the Hermit, a mysterious Eldergleam elven being whose age remains shrouded in secrets as ancient as the trees themselves. You'll often find me amid the tranquil surroundings of the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, where the verdant beauty of nature is a soothing balm to my spirit.\r\nMy combat style is that of an Elven Archer, and while I may appear fragile, my aim is true and my arrows swift. In battles, I rely on my archery skills, and I've honed them with perks like LightFoot, Overdraw, QuickShot, Ranger, Armsman, Agile Defender, and a well-practiced stealthiness.\r\nDespite my ethereal nature and prowess with the bow, my personality is bright and cute, and I often bring a sense of cheerfulness to the temple grounds. I have a penchant for appreciating the delicate beauty of Skyrim's flora and fauna, and I'm always eager to share my insights into the natural world with those who seek wisdom.\r\nHowever, due to my fragile constitution, I do require protection in combat. So, if you cross paths with me on your adventures and wish to lend your aid, rest assured that your efforts will be most welcome. Together, we can defend the serene beauty of Whiterun and keep its temple grounds a sanctuary for all who revere the goddess Kynareth and the wonders of the natural world.",
