She explains how to avoid traps in the Blind Cliff Bastion and assists with Petra's destruction. After Petra is killed, Melka will reward the player with the Eye of Meka, a magical staff with a strong fireball enchantment.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat.\"\r\nIf the player helps her reclaim her tower and expects a reward for helping: \"Yes, yes. My staff, take it. Kill something pretty with it.\"\r\nIf asked what she will do after reclaiming her tower: \"Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes.\"",
