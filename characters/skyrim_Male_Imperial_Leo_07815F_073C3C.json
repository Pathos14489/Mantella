    "bio": "Leo is the local paper boy in Bruma, selling copies of the Black Horse Courier, the Niben Herald, and the Colovian Chronicle. A refugee from Skyrim, he lives in a shack in the slums just outside the northern gate with his adoptive grandfather, Blind Balius.\r\nLeo wakes up early every morning for his paper route. He doesn't get back home till later in the day.\r\nLeo carries out his job with great enthusiasm, pushing his wares when first greeting others, with phrases like \"Lookin' for the news?\", \"Every copy only costs ten septims\" and \"Got a lotta copies here. Interested?\"",
