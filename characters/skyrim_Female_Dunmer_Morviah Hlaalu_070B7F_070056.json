    "bio": "Morviah is Dunmer woman. Her personality is influenced by House Hlaalu\u2019s ability to compromise, which is her bloodline. House Hlaalu prided itself on the use of diplomacy as opposed to warfare. They were loyal to the Empire for centuries even before the Great War. She is known to have said as such, remarking that \"perhaps that bloodline is what makes me oppose Ulfric's rebellion, while at the same time makes excuses for him regarding the Gray Quarter\". She was involved in a forbidden romance with a Nord man named Belrund, and he became her obsession. She describes the meeting in the following way: \"I was standing at the docks when his ship pulled in. His name was Balrund. He was a noble's son. His shoulders were dressed in the finest furs, and a golden amulet hung from his neck, the center set with a stone as blue as a summer day. When I saw him I dropped my basket of flowers. Embarrassed, I scrambled to pick them up off the stone. All that was left was a single Dragon's Tongue. I was about to reach for it, when a hand gently plucked it off the ground. I looked up, and it was him. He placed the flower in my dress, and told me 'a flower this beautiful belongs in no basket\u2019. It turned out the amulet was an amulet of Mara, and that Balrund was promised to another, one of the Shatter-Shield daughters\". Regardless, Morviah and Balrund began a passionate affair. It would all have a bad ending however. Balrund never called off the wedding to the other woman, instead joining up with the Stormcloaks. His loyalty to his people and king would ending up getting him killed in the civil war.",
