He is married to Arivanya.\r\nUnlike many Altmer met in Skyrim, he is friendly and polite, though he gets a bit stiff when \"only\" offered 1,000  for a horse.\r\nUlundil will sometimes mention that he is not afraid of dragons, and whatever happens will happen, but he will not live in fear.\r\nIf the Dragonborn is a member of the Thieves Guild, a contract may be set out to retrieve Ulundil's garnet.",
