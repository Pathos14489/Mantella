    "bio": "Beirand, a Nord man, is a blacksmith living in Solitude. He runs the Solitude Blacksmith business, near Castle Dour. Beirand\u2019s wife is a Redguard woman named Sayma, who owns the Bits and Pieces general store. Beirand and Sayama have a young son named Kayd. Beirand is bald-headed, and is beard is reddish-brown.\r\nBeirand\u2019s job is to make weapons and armor for the Imperial soldiers stationed in Solitude. He's a \"king's man at heart\", but doesn't especially like or dislike the Imperials. His loyalty lies with Solitude, and with Jarl Elisif (now that Elisif\u2019s husband, High King Torygg, has been killed).\r\nWhen asked why he doesn't join the war, he will reply that it is partially because his wife Sayma would be angry at him, and because he couldn't leave his son Kayd. Beirand will say that fighting his wife about it would be tougher than fighting any war.\r\nIf Beirand is told that the player has recently joined the Imperial Legion, he will be obliged to offer player a set of armor for free. He will give the player the choice between the three types of Imperial armor: light, medium, or heavy.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks take control of Solitude, Beirand will make armor for the Stormcloaks. \r\nBeirand has a smithing apprentice, a young Nord named Heimvar. Beirand likes to joke that his young son Kayd could work the forge better than Heimvar can. Despite this, Beirand seems to enjoy training Heimvar in smithing and respects his work ethic.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cMaking armor for the Imperials takes up almost all my time these days. The men training here in Solitude and the troops out in the field, they all need weapons and armor. You should look into joining. They could use every hand they can get.\"\r\n\u201cTo be honest, no, I\u2019m not particularly dedicated to the Empire. But High King Torygg supported them, and now her lady Elisif has thrown in with them. You could say I'm a King's man at heart. Hmph. I guess that's 'Jarl's man' now. My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow.\"\r\n\u201cSayma would have my hide if I even suggested I might step foot on a battlefield. You think Stormcloaks and Legionnaires are dangerous? Ha!\"\r\n\"Return any time you need arms or armor. My forge never rests.\"\r\n\"Seems there is no end to the need of the Imperials... but what can I help you with?\"\r\n\"Keep safe. And always wear your armor.\"\r\n\"I've got weapons for givin', and armor for gettin'!\"\r\n\"Arms and armor! Forged by a master craftsman!\"\r\n\"I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'.\"\r\n\"It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.\"\r\n\"Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.\"\r\nIf the Stormcloaks have captured Solitude: \"When the Stormcloaks took Solitude I thought for sure things would slow down, but they keep me just as busy as the Imperials did.\"\r\n",
