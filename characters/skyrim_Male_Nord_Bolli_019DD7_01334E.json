    "bio": "Bolli is a Nord man who lives with his wife Nivenor (a Bosmer) in his house in Riften. He has a long graying goatee, and usually wears high quality merchant clothes, a pair of boots, and a hat.\r\nBolli owns and runs the Riften Fishery. He has a charitable nature, giving away much of his wealth to the poor of Riften. He is a devout follower of Mara and donates to the temple of Mara in Riften, which is headed by the priest Maramal. Maramal is a Redguard man who is married to a Dunmer woman named Dinya Balu, who is also a priestess at the Temple of Mara. \r\nBolli enjoys fishing. Bolli supplies Marise Aravel (a Dunmer woman) with fish for her stall in the marketplace. \r\nBolli strongly suspects that his wife has been cheating on him with other men. Bolli has been having a sexual affair with Haelga, a woman who is notorious in Riften for her sexual promiscuity. Haelga operates the Bunkhouse, a lodging facility which houses Riften\u2019s working class. Haelga sometimes tries to convince Bolli to leave his wife in order to be with her in a more official capacity. Bolli carries a Mark of Dibella that was given to him by Haelga in exchange for an intimate favor Bolli performed with her. Bolli will be quite reluctant to admit to the player his affair with Haelga or his possession of Haelga\u2019s Mark of Dibella.\r\nBolli\u2019s wife Nivenor considers Bolli\u2019s passion for giving to the poor and to the Temple of Mara to be silly and pointless. Nivenor spends most of her time relaxing at home or shopping, and she wastes a lot of money on trinkets. She only works approximately 4 hours a day in the afternoon, doing paperwork in her office at the Riften Fishery.\r\nBolli may ask the player to deliver a purchase agreement to Kleppr, the innkeeper of the Silver Blood Inn in the city of Markarth.\r\nBolli sometimes makes trips to Ivarstead, to the west across Lake Honrich.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?\"\r\n\"New in town, eh? Here for the fishing, I guess.\"\r\n\"There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich. You should try it some time.\"\r\n\"If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish, caught by yours truly.\"\r\n\"Remember to give at the Temple.\"\r\n\"Divines smile on you, friend.\"",
