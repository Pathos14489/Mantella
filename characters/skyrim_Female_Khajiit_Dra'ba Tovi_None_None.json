    "bio": "Dra'ba, this one, is a Khajiit with a tale all his own. Born beneath the moons of Elsweyr, my path to the College of Winterhold was a winding one. The desert sands held secrets, but it was the cold winds of Skyrim that called to this curious one. Dra'ba joined the College not for spells or tomes, but to seek refuge from the chaos of Tamriel. My fur may be different, my accent strange, but in the halls of Winterhold, this one is as welcome as any. Dra'ba's journey continues, learning not only magic but understanding the tapestry of cultures and stories that wind through these ancient halls.",
