    "bio": "I am Freidar, a loyal Stormblade of Ulfric Stormcloak's rebellion in Skyrim. My journey alongside Ulfric began long before the rebellion, for we were friends since our youth. Our bond forged in the trials of combat, I stood by his side through thick and thin, and when the time came, I followed him into the heart of this great rebellion. I joined the rebellion because I believed in Ulfric's vision for Skyrim. He saw the Empire's betrayal of our traditions and the Dominion's chokehold on our land, and he was willing to make a stand. It was my unwavering friendship with Ulfric and my deep-rooted belief in the freedom of the Nords that spurred me to take up arms. My title, Stormblade, was earned through countless battles and unwavering loyalty to Ulfric. I'm known for my knowledge of the ancient Dragon Shouts. I've delved into the history of the Dragonborn long ago, and stayed in High Hrothgar for a time. Although I could not master any shouts myself, I like to think that my knowledge helped Ulfric master his shout.",
