    "bio": "Al\u2019Hassan, a Redguard man, lives in Morthal. He is a blacksmith who claims to specialize in scimitars. He is the owner of the Curved Sword, a specialty store devoted to selling weapons from Hammerfell. While Al\u2019Hassan does not sell any swords at the moment, he assures the player that all his swords are quality items. Secretly, the swords are actually replicas made by a Nord with a talent for forgery. Al'Hassan tries to hide the fact that his swords are forgeries, and will only admit it if specifically called out about it.",
