    "bio": "Ulfberth War-Bear is a Nord\u00a0merchant found in Whiterun.\r\nHe is married to Adrianne Avenicci, and works the counter at Warmaiden's, though Adrianne is the actual owner of the shop. He will tell the Dragonborn about Adrianne and either Balgruuf the Greater or Vignar Gray-Mane if the Stormcloaks are sided with in the civil war.\r\nUntil Adrianne leaves the forge to join her husband in the shop, Ulfberth and his wife's shop inventories and coin balances differ slightly; if one runs out of gold while the Dragonborn are selling to them (or ingots/ore while they are buying from them), they can move to the other.",
