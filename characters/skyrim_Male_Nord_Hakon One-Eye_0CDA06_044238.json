He can be observed at the Throat of the World\u00a0during the quest\u00a0Alduin's Bane, and later found in the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde, during the quest \"Sovngarde.\"\r\nHakon, along with Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, and Felldir the Old, fought Alduin atop the Throat of the World during the Dragon War.\r\nAfter Gormlaith Golden-Hilt was killed by Alduin, Felldir the Old used the Elder Scroll to banish Alduin before he could stop them. The use of the Elder Scroll created a time wound that remains to the present day.\r\nHakon\u00a0helps the Dragonborn defeat Alduin in the main questline. Upon completion of the quest, Hakon One-Eye can be summoned to aid the Dragonborn in Tamriel with the Call of Valor shout.",
