    "bio": "Not much is known about Jorgen's past, except that he has descended from one of the elite members of the Keepers of the Razor, that fought to rid Skyrim of Daedra worshippers after the Oblivion Crisis, and kept the fragments of Mehrunes' Razor apart. Jorgen's line, in particular, is holding onto the hilt.\r\nHe lives with his wife Lami and he seems to be quite arrogant, telling the Dragonborn to leave him alone, and that he does not like Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone's and her leadership.\r\nJorgen is one of the keepers of a part of Mehrunes' Razor, more specifically, the hilt. He can be convinced to give the hilt by purchasing it, brawling,persuasion or breaking into his house.\r\nJorgen, along with his wife, Lami, are some of the \"strong citizens\" sent by the Jarl to accompany the player character to Movarth's Lair, though are just as quick to abandon the mission when faced with the vampire threat.",
