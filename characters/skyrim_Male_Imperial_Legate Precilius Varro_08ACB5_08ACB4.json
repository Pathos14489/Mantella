    "bio": "Legate Precilius Varro is the ranking officer at Fort Pale Pass in Cyrodiil, just south of the Pale Bass border with Skyrim. The rank of legate is analogous to a colonel.\r\nVarro is having trouble interrogating a Stormcloak prisoner, is open to enlisting help on this matter.\r\nAs a separate issue, a soldier named Harran Iron-Heart mysteriously vanished while on patrol in the Jerall Mountains a few months ago, and has not been seen since.\r\nLegate Varro spends much time in the fort's courtyard, hearing fresh reports from his troops. On Middas, he spends a few hours at the pulpit in the chapel, presiding over the weekly meeting of his troops.\r\nHe wears a full set of Imperial armor: cuirass, boots, bracers, and an officer's helmet. He is armed with an Imperial sword and shield.",
