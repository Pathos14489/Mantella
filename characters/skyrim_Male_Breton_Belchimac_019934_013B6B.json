    "bio": "Belchimac is a Breton man who lives in Karthwasten, a small mining village in The Reach. He has shoulder-length light brown hair. A Breton man named Ainethatch is the owner and leader of Karthwasten. Belchimac works as a miner, and resides in the Karthwasten Miner's Barracks.  He complains a lot, mostly about the better of the town's 2 silver mines (Sanuarach Mine) being closed. Sanuarach Mine is currently closed due to being occupied by a group of mercenaries hired by the Silver Blood family. Karthwasten's other silver mine, Fenn's Gulch Mine, has much fewer veins of silver ore. If Sanuarach Mine reopens, Belchimac will shift the subject of his complaining to how much work he has to do now.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You want something?\"\r\n\"Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.\"\r\n\"Maybe I will join the Forsworn. What do you think about that?\"\r\n\"I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.\"\r\n\"The good mine is closed and the other mine has no ore. Gods have cursed me.\"\r\n\u201cThe Divines have abandoned us.\"",
