    "bio": "Grimvar Cruel-Sea is a Nord child\u00a0inhabiting Windhelm.\r\nHe lives in House of Clan Cruel-Sea in Windhelm. He is the son of Torsten Cruel-Sea and Hillevi Cruel-Sea. He had a sister, Fjotli Cruel-Sea, before she was killed.\r\nThe Dragonborn can play tag with Grimvar. If talked to, he may ask to play a game (either tag or hide and seek). It does not earn any rewards, though.\r\nWhen visiting Windhelm for the first time, Grimvar and his nanny, Idesa Sadri, are talking about Aventus Aretino and his performing the Black Sacrament in his home. Idesa quotes that Aventus Aretino is a strange child and she is the only friend Grimvar needs.\r\nGrimvar says his father wants him to be a farmer or a sailor, but he does not want to be either of those and instead wants to be a warrior.",
