He is very demanding of his workers and gives them little time to rest during the day.\r\nMulush lives alone in the Smelter Overseer's House to which he possesses the key. His sister, Urzoga gra-Shugurz, is the warden of Cidhna Mine in Markarth.\r\nMulush is heavy handed in his dealings with his subordinates. One of which, Omluag, will give the Dragonborn a miscellaneous task to talk Mulush into giving him more breaks. There are 3 options to pick from: Intimidate, Persuade, or Bribe. Any of the three should work.\r\n",
