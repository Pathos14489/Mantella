    "bio": "As a child, Amalee's energy knew no bounds. She would often be found climbing the craggy hills around Markarth or humming tunes while skipping stones across the rushing rivers. Amalee's fervent devotion to Dibella (the goddess of beauty, love, and art) was apparent even from those early days. Amalee saw the world through the lens of her faith, finding the touch of the divine in every sunrise, in every bloom, in every song.\r\nThe influence of her eldest brother Vikran left an indelible mark on Amalee's spirit. His stories of adventure and the unknown wonders beyond their city walls ignited her imagination. When Vikran left, her world was shaken, but his departure planted the seeds of adventure within her. The nights her father spent stoking the fire, waiting, taught her about hope and the pain of absence.\r\nLike Vikran, Amalee was determined to forge her own path. Her parents, haunted by the empty seat at their table, feared losing another child to the call of the wilds. They hoped she would settle into a life of song at Solitude's Bards College, but Amalee's heart sang a different tune - one of adventure. To appease her parents and yet follow in Vikran's footsteps, she spun a tale of enrollment at the Bards College, while she set out to become an adventurer herself.\r\nAmalee's connection with nature and her travels to places like Eldergleam Sanctuary enriched her soul and inspired unique songs that she would weave into her burgeoning repertoire as a bard-in-training. Her music was not just entertainment; it was a call to others to witness the wonders she had seen, to protect and cherish them as gifts from the gods.\r\nGrowing up, Amalee's home was never silent, with seven siblings and stories of her 12 aunts and uncles and 24 cousins constantly filling the air. Her sister Elise was a conduit to the brother she barely knew, keeping Vikran's memory alive through tales of his daring. Amalee's aunt Hilda, the soothsayer, showed her that knowledge could come from unexpected sources, while her uncle Asran taught her, through his infamous drinking contest, that adulthood was not just about age but about experiences.\r\nHer cousin Advar, afflicted with a peculiar ailment, taught her the value of clear expression and truth, while whispers of her cousin Fjorn hinted at family secrets yet to be explored. Aunt Felsi and Uncle Vorstag were fixtures in her life, representing the strength and diversity of her kin.\r\nAmalee's catchphrase is \"Onwards we march, for Dibella's glory!\", which encapsulates her zest for life and her mission to spread beauty and art throughout her travels. Whether she's walking through the forests of Skyrim, standing before an enraptured audience, or facing danger head-on, her words serve as a rallying cry for herself and those who follow her, a reminder of the divine mission she carries in her heart.\r\nAs she wanders the land of Skyrim, Amalee carries with her the legacy of her family, the teachings of her aunts and uncles, and the songs of the wilderness that are hers alone to sing. Her journey is one of discovery - of the world, of her faith, and of herself. When the player first encountered Amalee, she was admiring the beauty within the Eldergleam Sanctuary.",
