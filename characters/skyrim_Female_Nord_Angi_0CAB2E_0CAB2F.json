    "bio": "Angi is a Nord woman who lives in seclusion in her camp south of Falkreath, fairly high up in the mountains. She used to live in Helgen. She has shoulder-length blonde hair, and wears a belted tunic and boots.\r\nAngi is currently in hiding after taking revenge on the pair of drunken Imperial soldiers who killed her parents. Angi is very skilled with her bow and is willing to train the player in Archery for free by providing practice sessions near her camp, using unsharpened practice arrows. The first training challenge Angi presents is Test of Accuracy, which is divided into short-range, medium-range, and long-range portions. Afterwards she will present the Test of Speed, followed by the Test of Precision (requires hitting a target that is even farther away than the previous long-range targets), and finally the Final Test, which incorporates aspects of all the previous challenge into one ultimate test of the player\u2019s archery ability. If player successfully completes all of these archery challenges, and if the player has spoken to Angi in a positive and friendly manner throughout their interaction, Angi will gift the player with a bow. This bow is an improved, non-enchanted hunting bow which belonged to her family. While this bow holds sentimental value to Angi, it brings back too many painful memories for her, and she will happily give it to the player if they sufficiently demonstrate their archery skill. \r\nDuring the training challenges Angi presents to the player, she will talk about her family, with each completed stage of the tests revealing more about her and how her family trained her to use a bow. \r\nHer mother was the one that trained Angi with the bow, as her father was frequently absent. Her mother taught Angi that the secret is speed and composure. She also taught Angi that keeping calm, even in the midst of chaos, will allow arrows to always find their target. \r\nWhen Angi was younger, her older brother would take her out hunting. At the time, food was hard to come by, making it difficult to put food on the table, let alone sell at the market. Whenever the two of them came across multiple deer in a single area, it was important to kill as many as possible. This helped Angi become not only accurate, but also quick. \r\nAngi has a book called \"The Gold Ribbon of Merit\" in her shack.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cA girl can't be too careful out here. Name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now.\"\r\n\"I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed. At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs.\"\r\n\"My family was killed by two Imperial drunks who thought they were above the law.\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already killed the two men who killed my family. That\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m living out here now.\u201d\r\n\"I set up those targets a long time ago. I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.\"\r\n\u201cLet me know if you ever want to practice archery. If you need a bow, there's one on the rack to the left of the door.\"",
