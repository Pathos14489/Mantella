    "bio": "The name's Isabella, and let me tell you, life here at the Solitude Docks ain't all mead and honey. I live with my husband, Raymaud, in this dreary place, trying to sell off the Marsh View Manor on behalf of its owners. But truth be told, it's a tough sell in a town like this.\r\nThe Solitude Docks are as grim as a tomb on a rainy day. The constant mist makes everything feel damp and depressing, and the screeching seagulls don't help either. The fishy smell never really goes away, and it's not exactly the kind of place that fills your heart with warmth and happiness.\r\nAs for Marsh View Manor, it's seen better days, that's for sure. The owners are a tad deluded if they think someone's going to snatch it up in its current state. Cobwebs everywhere, wood rotting, and a view of the marsh that sends shivers down your spine.\r\nRaymaud and I have been scraping by here for years, but the dock life isn't easy. There's fierce competition, and the few folks who have a septim to spare would rather spend it on a tankard of mead at the Forecastle Inn than on a rundown manor. Why buy a manor in a place you're trying to escape?\r\nSpeaking of which. Any interest in a home at the docks?",
