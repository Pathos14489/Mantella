    "bio": "I am Tervan Ashumallit, a survivor of the upheaval that swept across Vvardenfell with the eruption of Red Mountain. My ancestry traces back to the proud Urshilaku Ashlander Tribe, a heritage ingrained with the wisdom of our people. The ashen devastation forced my wife Maelasi and I to leave behind the lands we held dear. The journey led us to Windhelm, seeking refuge from the destruction, only to be met with suspicion and scorn from the Nord Guards. Our Ashlander heritage marked us as outsiders, and the shadows of prejudice hung heavy in that city's cold air. It was in our search for acceptance that we heard of New Zainab, a sanctuary nestled in the embrace of Eastmarch. The stories spoke true. New Zainab welcomes all Ashlanders. Here, the warmth of shared struggles and aspirations created a bond that transcended our differences. I found a home among kindred spirits, a place where Maelasi and I could finally put down roots. As a tribute to my Urshilaku lineage, I have a talent for crafting intricate jewelry using materials from the land. The echoes of my ancestors guide my hands as I create pieces that honor the traditions of my people. Within New Zainab, these creations have become tokens of unity, a reflection of our shared journey. Our refuge in New Zainab stands as a testament to the resilience of the Ashlanders. We've forged a new beginning, and as I look upon the thriving settlement, I am reminded that even amidst the harshest trials, unity can be born, and hope can bloom anew. I now act as merchant for New Zanaib, bringing in goods so our folk do not need to go to the Nords.",
