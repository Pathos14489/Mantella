She usually wears a set of scaled light armor, and carries a sword on her hip.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nIn the evening, Gianna sometimes visits the Windpeak Inn, a popular tavern run by a widower named Thoring.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Make it quick.\"",
