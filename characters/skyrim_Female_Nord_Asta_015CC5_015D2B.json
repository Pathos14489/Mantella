    "bio": "Asta is a Nord woman and worshipper of Kynareth who can be found in Eldergleam Sanctuary, along with a Nord man named Sond. She has light red hair and blue eyes. Eldergleam Sanctuary is an underground grove and worship site of the followers of Kynareth. This sanctuary is located directly north of Darkwater Crossing, among the sulphurous pools and hot springs of Eastmarch.\r\nIf the player shows Asta that they have the dagger Nettlebane, she will become angry and beg the player not to use Nettlebane to harm the Eldergleam tree.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?\"\r\n\u201cAs you can see, Eldergleam's roots are large and stretch far, blocking any path to her trunk.\u201d\r\nIf the player is carrying Nettlebane: \u201cYou carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.\"",
