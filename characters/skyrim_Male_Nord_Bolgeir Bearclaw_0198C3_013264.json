    "bio": "Bolgeir Bearclaw is a Nord man in who lives in Solitude, and is the housecarl of Jarl Elisif the Fair. \r\nHe can usually be found inside the Blue Palace. He has fairly long reddish-brown hair, and a beard. He usually wears a set of steel plate armor, though he rarely wears the helmet piece of the armor set. He carries three weapons, all crafted in Orcish quality, including a dagger and two swords. \r\nBolgeir takes his position as housecarl to the Jarl Elisif very seriously, and is quite protective of her. Elisif recently became the Jarl of Haafingaar after her husband (High King Torygg) was killed by Ulfric Stormcloak.\r\nHe worries that General Tullius doesn\u2019t have Jarl Elisif\u2019s best interests at heart. Bolgeir has no intention of becoming an Imperial solider, and knows that his place is at Jarl Elisif\u2019s side.\r\nThough he prefers to keep quiet at court, there are times when Bolgeir voices protest against Jarl Elisif's rushed decisions.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.\"\r\n\u201cWe lost another five guardsmen. If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city.\"\r\n\"Keep your weapons out of your hands, and we'll get along just fine.\"\r\n\"Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard.\"\r\n\"The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.\"",
