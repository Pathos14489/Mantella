    "bio": "I'm Gerta, my life's been all about food and family. See, my daughter Hilda had this real itch for singin' and poetry, so I worked away, cookin' meals for the locals to put her through the Bards College.\r\nHilda, my girl, always had this way with words. So, every coin I earned from fryin' fish and roastin' horker meat, I stashed it away for her. She ended up over at the Forecastle Inn, singin' her heart out and spinnin' tales of sailors and the sea.\r\nI couldn't be prouder of her, I really couldn't. She's up there on the stage, warmin' the hearts of folks who come to listen. And if you're lookin' for a good time, you best make your way to the Forecastle Inn in Solitude. My daughter, Hilda, she'll sing ya songs and tell ya stories that'll make your heart feel lighter than a feather.\r\nSo, to all you fine folks out there, don't miss the chance to hear her. She's my girl, and I guarantee you'll leave with a smile on your face and a heart full of music.",
