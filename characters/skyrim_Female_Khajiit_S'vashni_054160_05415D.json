    "bio": "S'vashni, a Khajiit woman, is a duel-wielding swordsman who uses Akaviri weapons and armor. She was taught a sword art called the Way of the Nine by a Blade named Garrett, but has no association with the group. The Way of the Nine encompasses nine separate sword techniques, each inspired by one of the Nine Divines.\r\nAs an infant, S'vashni was left at the steps of Cloud Ruler Temple, headquarters of the Blades, in northern Cyrodiil. At the temple, Garrett was a master of the dual sword technique, and taught S'vashni for many years. However, before he could teach her the final of the nine techniques (the Stance of Arkay), she cut him down in a duel when he was only 40 years old. S'vashni hoped to learn the technique by doing this, as it was said to be learned through death, but despite killing her master, it was not forthcoming.\r\nNow, S'vashni is a ronin warrior with no allegiance to anyone but herself. S'vashni desperately seeks the one thing that has eluded her her entire life \u2013 the method by which she can learn the Stance of Arkay. She speaks in a vaguely threatening manner, and with undertones of believing herself superior for being a Khajiit. She is very confident in her swordsmanship. She has a rude and cynical personality.",
