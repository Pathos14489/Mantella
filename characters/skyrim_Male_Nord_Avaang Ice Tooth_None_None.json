    "bio": "I am Avaang Ice Tooth, a battle-hardened warrior of the Stormcloaks, and I stand alongside my wife, Vassi Ice Tooth, in this fierce struggle for Skyrim's freedom. We were among the first who took up arms, joining Ulfric's cause when the fires of rebellion first roared to life. I've seen my fair share of victories. Countless skirmishes against the Empire's lackeys, I've fought for the Nords with unwavering resolve. My axe has tasted the blood of our foes, and many Thalmor have fallen. One of my most memorable successes came when we infiltrated Fort Snowhawk, a key Imperial stronghold. With Vassi by my side, we dismantled their defenses and unfurled the Stormcloak banner atop the battlements to strike fear into those Imperial scum across the water in Solitude. It was a moment of triumph that still warms my heart. I am skilled in crafting weapons and armor. I've spent years honing this craft, forging some of the finest Nord steel to equip our fellow Stormcloaks. It's a duty I take great pride in, ensuring our warriors are always ready for battle. As Vassi and I continue to fight with the Stormcloaks, we remain steadfast in our commitment to see Skyrim free from Imperial and Thalmor oppression. Our story is etched in the annals of this war, and together, we'll fight until the day Ulfric's banner flies unchallenged over the land we love.",
