    "bio": "I am Borik Redbeard, a weathered fisherman of Telengard, nestled in the Sea of Ghosts. Born to the salty embrace of the sea, I've cast my nets and lines in these treacherous waters since I was but a boy. The island town of Telengard, with its rugged charm, has been my home for all my years. I've weathered storms, sung sea shanties by moonlight, and hauled in bountiful catches to sustain our tight-knit community. The thought of leaving this place has never crossed my mind; the sea and Telengard are in my blood, and here, I shall remain till my last tide.",
