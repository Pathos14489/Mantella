    "bio": "Delacourt, a young Breton man, works as a bard. His hair is a darker shade of blond, and he has a thin mustache. He wears merchant-style clothing.\r\nDelacourt can usually be found in Dead Man's Drink in Falkreath, often performing for the inn\u2019s patrons. He sings and plays the lute. An Imperial woman named Valga Vinicia is the innkeeper of Dead Man\u2019s Drink. Delacourt will play song requests, such as Ragnar the Red and The Age of Aggression. He was trained at the Bard's College in Solitude. Delacourt may suggest that the player apply to join the Bard\u2019s College. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Keep in song in your heart to ward off the gloom.\"\r\n\"Perhaps one day, I'll write a song about you!\"",
