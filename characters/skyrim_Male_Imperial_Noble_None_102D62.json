His attire matches his status and consists of expensive fine clothing.\r\nIf approached by other travelers, he acts rude and easily annoyed. If attacked he will flee rather than fight, despite carrying a high-quality dagger.\r\nExample dialogue:\r\n\"I have nothing to say to you. Now move along, or I'll order my guards to attack.\"\r\nIf not currently accompanied by a bodyguard: \"Keep away. If I am harmed, people will come looking.\"",
