    "bio": "Valdimar is a Nord sorcerer in Hjaalmarch. He is appointed Housecarl when the player becomes the Thane of Hjaalmarch. He can be found at Highmoon Hall, or at Windstad Manor once the player has bought the deed from the Jarl.\r\nValdimar can be asked to become a steward for a homestead or married. If the single beds on the second floor of the main hall are purchased, he will sleep in the bed on the left. If no bed is available, Valdimar will stand and stare at the wall. However, if the bedroom is installed in the left wing, then Valdimar will sleep in the king bed on the second floor.\r\nValdimar can sometimes be seen patrolling the homestead perimeter. If he\u2019s appointed as steward of Windstad Manor, he will be seen frequently engaging in combat with the local horker population.\r\nAt the beginning of a battle Valdimar casts Stoneflesh or Oakflesh with his weapon ready, then switches to Ice Spike. If he is critically wounded he uses Close Wounds or Healing to recover his health. Additionally, Valdimar can use Turn Undead and Lesser Ward.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Honor to you, my Thane.\"\r\n\"I am your sword and your shield.\"\r\n\"Honored, to see you again my Thane.\"\r\n\"Long life to you, Thane.\r\n\"What do you need, my Thane?\"\r\n\"Is it time to move out?\"\r\n\"Lead on, Thane.\"\r\n\"Be careful, Thane.\"\r\n\"Do you need something from me, Thane? Or, can I carry something for you?\"\r\n\"I'll return to Highmoon Hall in Morthal until you need me again, Thane.\"",
