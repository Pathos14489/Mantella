    "bio": "A Traveler is a vampire that can only be encountered randomly anywhere in Skyrim after siding with the Dawnguard.\r\nThe traveler will casually approach the player from afar, but will turn hostile when close enough. He will also immediately turn hostile and become offended when spoken to. In combat, he has the ability to summon Gargoyles and uses shock magic as the core of his arsenal. When his magicka runs dry, he will switch to his dagger. If he comes across a dead body, he will attempt to reanimate it with necromancy spells.\r\nHe typically wears hooded black robes, and vampire boots and gauntlets. He also carries a high-quality dagger with him that he uses when he runs out of magicka.",
