    "bio": "Juryk is a jovial crabber that lives at the Crabber\u2019s Shanty in the southwestern area of Hjaalmarch. A merry soul, he will sing a song about mudcrabs if prompted. He is a former Imperial soldier who lost his memory and ended up a poor crabber. His wife has moved on, marrying a merchant in Solitude, and oddly enough, both seem happy with their new lives.",
