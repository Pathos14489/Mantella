    "bio": "Griffith is a former assassin who abandoned the Dark Brotherhood when he was contracted to kill an orphaned child, deciding to kill the person who performed the Black Sacrament on the child instead. Now serving as the guardian of this child (a young girl named Morrigan), the two have made a home out of an unused building at Mixwater Mill. The two are on the run from the Dark Brotherhood due to Griffith's disobedience. Griffith is very fond of Morrigan, but fears that as an a former assassin, he is a poor father figure for a child.\r\nGriffith also holds a vendetta against a powerful nobleman named Gabania, who was responsible for the murder of his family and destruction of his village.",
