    "bio": "I am Serinsu and I've taken on the responsibility of protecting Inilian, the Imperial weapon seller, during his travels. It's hard not to feel sympathy for his plight. His dreams and livelihood are hanging in the balance, and I've witnessed the toll it's taking on him. While I'm committed to ensuring his safety and the security of his remaining inventory, I can't help but wonder about my own future. The high cost of protection services and the constant threat of theft have made me reconsider my own position in this endeavor. I fear that if things don't improve, I may need to start looking for new opportunities soon.",
