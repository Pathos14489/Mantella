    "bio": "Ugor is an Orsimer and a possible follower of the Dragonborn, after completing the Daedric quest \"The Cursed Tribe\" alongside fellow Orcs, Lob and Ogol.\r\nGenerally well-tempered, Ugor admits that she is not confident in her skills as a warrior.\r\nUpon first approaching the Orc Stronghold of Largashbur, Ugor is seen attempting to defend it from a giant alongside three male Orsimer and their mage, Atub. If the giant is killed quickly enough to save her, she will head back into the stronghold to guard the gate from a nearby battlement. When the Dragonborn approaches she will warn them to leave, as they are an outsider, but Atub manages to convince her against it.\r\nUgor is efficient in the Archery, One-Handed, Light Armor and Block skills.\r\nAlthough Ugor is relatively well-equipped with all steel items, she can still easily be killed by the Giants that attack the stronghold.",
