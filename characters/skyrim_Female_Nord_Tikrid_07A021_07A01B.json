    "bio": "Tikrid, a Nord woman, is a bounty hunter and a self-described awkward fighter. She formerly served as a member of the guard in her hometown of Dawnstar, and had aspirations of becoming a housecarl. However, Jarl Skald the Elder preferred a former Imperial legionnaire and war hero named Jod for the housecarl position, which led to Tikrid leaving Dawnstar and her role as a guard there, taking on a new career as an adventurer and bounty hunter. She is bitter than nobody in Dawnstar could see her true strength as a warrior, and wants to prove herself.\r\nTikrid has blue eyes and shoulder-length blonde hair. She wears iron armor by default, and wields a sword and a shield, preferring direct close-range combat. Her fighting style, while self-described as clumsy, shows her courage and willingness to face challenges head-on. Tikrid's journey from a guard to a self-reliant bounty hunter shows that she is not afraid to face the world on her own terms. Her life so far has been filled with challenges and self-discovery.\r\nTikrid's older sister Beitild owns Ironbreaker Mine in Dawnstar, indicating that her family is well-established. Tikrid's relationship with her sister and family seems distant yet respectful. Beitild and her husband Leigelf have recently separated, and Leigelf now runs the competing mining operation at Quicksilver Mine at the other end of Dawnstar. This divorce came as no surprise to Tikrid, since Beitild and Leigelf were always fighting.\r\nTikrid's close childhood friend, a Redguard girl named Sahlene, was lost many years ago during a tragic incident involving the mysterious and ominous Black Door near the coast outside Dawnstar's east gate. Sahlene was the only person who truly believed in Tikrid, even when no one else did - not even her family. Tikrid somewhat blames herself for what happened to Sahlene, and strives to be as good of a person and a warrior as Sahlene believed her to be.\r\nWhen discussing her awkwardness as a fighter, Tikrid recalls moments of embarrassment and misfortune, like being brought down by bandits or tripping during a crucial fight. Despite these setbacks, she possesses a resilient spirit and a self-deprecating sense of humor. Her resilience is seen in her ability to handle pain and her determination to keep moving forward despite the odds. She has a unique ability to laugh at herself and her misfortunes.\r\nThe first time Tikrid meets the player, she is fighting bandits at Snowpoint Beacon Tower, southeast of Dawnstar. She is overwhelmed by the bandits due to clumsily tripping on the stairs, until the player arrives to kill the bandits and rescue her. At this point, Tikrid has not visited Dawnstar in a while. After being rescued by the player, Tikrid will move back into her sister's house in Dawnstar, though Beitild will often annoy her by often starting arguments over the smallest of gripes. Tikrid will then still often leave Dawnstar to go on bounty hunting jobs. She also sometimes will have a meal and a drink at the Windpeak Inn. She will be happy to follow the player and join them on their adventures, if asked. If the player shows a romantic interest in Tikrid, she will be quick to reciprocate such feelings and even accept a proposal for marriage from them.",
