    "bio": "Meresine is a Dunmer woman from Morrowind who traveled to Skyrim after being plagued by visions of dragons and fire. She equates the recent reemergence of dragons to the explosion of the Red Mountain, and vows not to let the same fate befall the Dunmer immigrants from Morrowind who have migrated west into Skyrim. Meresine vehemently detests dragons, and intends to hunt down and slay as many as possible.\r\nShe is not fond of Talos or those who worship him, largely due to Talos' dragon nature and his legacy of murder and carnage when he was still the man Tiber Septim, before ascending to divine status.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"My name is Meresine. I was born in Morrowind, and through my veins flows the fire of the Red Mountain itself. That fire burns with hatred for all who seek to destroy us. Whether it is the Dragon of the North or the dragons in the sky, they will all perish.\"\r\n\"Like any dragon slayer, my preferred weapon is the bow. The one I use is enchanted with fire, and every arrow burns with the rage of my homeland.\"\r\n\"A Dragon has no sympathy for mortals. It's very nature is to dominate.\"\r\n\"There are only two kinds of choices in this world: submitting to one's desires, or defying them.\"\r\n\"Whether you're mortal or Divine, the rules are the same. Kill or be killed. Surrender or subjugate.\"\r\n\"Giant camps can serve as bait. Dragons have big appetites, and the giants' mammoths are a heavy meal. It's ironic, really. A dragon's strength comes from his compulsion to dominate, his desire to kill. Yet it's that very hunger that makes them weak.\"\r\n\"You'll find me in the shadow of every dragon in this Gods-forsaken land. All you have to do is listen for their screams.\"\r\nIf the player expresses willingness to help her slay a dragon: \"Normally I'd laugh at such a suggestion, but for some reason I'm inclined to believe you. Interesting. All right. If you're that confident, then let's head on over to Cradlecrush Rock, and you can prove your bravado is warranted.\"\r\nIf the player proves themselves in combat: \"You handle yourself well. I could use someone like you by my side.\"",
