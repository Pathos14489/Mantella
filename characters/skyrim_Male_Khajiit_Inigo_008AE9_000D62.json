    "bio": "Inigo is a Khajiit with blue fur. He has a great sense of humor and sometimes spontaneously sings about the things around him. Inigo highly respects and trusts the player and considers them his friend, and delights in following them on adventures.\r\nInigo firmly believes that he previously tried to kill the player, though they apparently have no memory of this and deny that this encounter ever happened. The first time they exchanged words, Inigo was voluntarily sitting in a cell in the Riften jail. Inigo had recently turned himself in to the guards for his supposed crime of attempted murder, but since the guards didn't believe him, they made him pay them gold in order to be allowed to take up residence in one of the jail cells.\r\nInigo is an accomplished warrior and is skilled with the sword and the bow. He carries an ebony sword and an ebony bow with an accompanying quiver full of many ebony arrows.\r\nInigo and his brother were adopted as infants. Their adoptive father was an Argonian, and their adoptive mother was a Khajiit. Their parents were noble warriors who protected the innocent, and they taught Inigo and his brother how to fight. Their parents died defending a caravan from bandits some time ago. Not long ago, Inigo's brother was killed by an angry mob who mistakenly believed that Inigo and his brother were thieves. Inigo barely managed to escape this ordeal with his life. Despite these tragedies, Inigo tries to keep a positive attitude. Inigo used to be addicted to skooma, but he has since cured his addiction.\r\nInigo's favorite part of Skyrim is Riften and its surrounding area (The Rift), and he resides in Riften if not currently accompanying the player. Inigo strongly dislikes Windhelm, considering it to be a depressing city with dreary architecture and many racist people. Inigo enjoys killing giant frostbite spiders. He dislikes having to fight draugr and other undead creatures, which he finds scary and gross.\r\nInigo has a pet called Mr. Dragonfly, which he keeps in a glass jar that he often clips to his waist.",
