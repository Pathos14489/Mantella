    "bio": "Shahvee is an Argonian that can be found working at the tanning rack, just outside the walls of Windhelm on Windhelm Docks.\r\nShe often appears in high spirits, telling the Dragonborn that, despite her difficult life, she has learned to be happy with what she has. It is revealed at the end of her personal quest, \"Shahvee's Amulet,\" that she was a former thief after she teaches the Dragonborn some of her old tricks.\r\nShahvee tasks the Dragonborn with recovering her amulet of Zenithar from Uttering Hills Cave, Gallows Rock, Stony Creek Cave or Lost Knife Hideout.\r\nIf the Dragonborn decides to accuse Wuunferth the Unliving of being the Butcher serial-killer in \"Blood on the Ice,\" the murders will continue in Windhelm. Shahvee is one of the possible targets for murder.\r\nAfter the Dragonborn completes \"Shahvee's amulet,\" she will become a marriage candidate and will offer that option during conversation if they are wearing an Amulet of Mara. Should they choose to marry her, she opens a shop, giving them 100  daily from the shop's profits. This amount stacks if uncollected. As with other merchants, the Dragonborn can buy and sell items with her.\r\nShahvee does not always present the quest required for marriage immediately upon first visitation. One of the likely solutions is to increase the Dragonborn's fame by completing quests in the main storyline.\r\nAre you always so happy? \"Oh yes. After all, what's the point in being miserable all the time? I know life on the docks isn't easy. Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose. But being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can.\"\r\nYour people have bad luck? \"We have not faired well outside of our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things. I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I'd bought it.\"\r\nInterested in me, are you?: \"You have a kind heart. I'd be honored to walk by your side until the trees themselves fade away. If you would have me.\"",
