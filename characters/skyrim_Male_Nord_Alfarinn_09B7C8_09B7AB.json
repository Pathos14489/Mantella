    "bio": "Alfarinn works as a carriage driver. He is a Nord man with reddish-brown hair. He can often be found near the stables outside the stone bridge at the city of Windhelm's main entrance. These stables are managed by a High Elf couple.\r\nFor a fee, Alfarinn allows customers to board his carriage, transporting them to their requested destination. Alfarinn can take travelers to any of the major cities and towns in Skyrim.\r\nAlfarinn often shares some information about the traveler's destination, or comments on the weather.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about Windhelm: \u201cWindhelm is an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of Kings is ancient. It's not the friendliest for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in the slum called the Gray Quarter. The Argonians can't even live in the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks. Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse.\"\r\nIf a customer asks for a ride to Morthal: \"Ah, Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Windhelm, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.\"",
