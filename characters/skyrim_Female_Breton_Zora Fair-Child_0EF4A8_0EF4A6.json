    "bio": "Zora Fair-child is a young Breton woman from Riverwood. She has blonde hair and blue eyes. She is short and petite, even for a Breton. She fights with a two-handed sword. In her youth, Zora was selfish and vain. She was called the \"Diamond of Riverwood\", but her personality was ugly. From the day she was born, Zora was considered the lucky child. Born with beauty and blessed with charm, she was a child destined to be loved. Her sister Joselyn on the other hand, was a quiet, homely mage - a girl destined to be scorned.\r\nOne day, out of jealousy (and due to a silly fight between sisters) Joselyn slapped Zora with a hand imbued with fire, and left a permanent hand-shaped burn mark on Zora's face.\r\nWhen Zora first lost her beauty as a result of this burn, she went through all the stages of grief, but it was the anger stage that was the most consequential. She subsequently stormed into the caves that surrounded the White River, with a sword twice her size strapped to her back. She partially hoped to be killed by the local packs of wolves around Riverwood, and charged at them with her sword in hand. Somehow, Zora managed to survive this ordeal. When she woke up from her anger-induced hysteria, she was an unrecognizable mess of scars. She began traveling around as an adventurer. With every new wound that marred her flesh, Zora cared about the loss of her physical beauty progressively less.\r\nDuring her childhood, Zora had a pet dog named Sir Cuddles. Zora has described Sir Cuddles as a dirty, flea-ridden mongrel, but also as very adorable. Sir Cuddles was once sick and almost died, but Joselyn crafted a potion to save the dog,\r\nZora's personal growth has been about feeling comfortable in her own skin. As such, it's no coincidence the one spell she knows is Oakflesh. Still, throughout her trials and tribulations, a part of her will never be at peace with what she's lost. Zora loves her sister Joselyn very much, and won't hesitate to come to Joselyn's aid if she hears that she is in danger. Zora wants to reconcile with Joselyn and apologize for how poorly she treated her in the past.\r\nZora has moments where she laughs at herself, or feels sorry for herself, but in the end she still has the resolve to move forward. She has been learning to accept the person she is. Despite her internal struggles, she usually carries herself with a light-hearted attitude and has a good sense of humor, often employing upbeat sarcasm. Zora comes across as a generally nice person, with a taste for all things sweet and lovely.\r\nWhen the player first finds Zora, she is locked inside a cage, captured by a necromancer within Brittleshin Pass, in the mountains between Whiterun and Falkreath. She has been captured by necromancers many times before (each time being rejected for use due to her marred face), so she isn't particularly worried about her situation. After the player frees her from her cage, Zora will ask to follow the player on their adventures. She will sometimes humorously and half-patronizingly refer to the player as her gallant hero.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"My name is Zora Fair-Child, although it was never meant to be ironic. I was once very much a child, and very much fair. So fair, in fact, the Divines saw fit to punish me with this marred and unenviable face. It's always easier to blame the gods for such things, isn't it?\".\r\n\"You go, I'll follow.\"\r\nIf asked what sort of rescuer she was waiting for: \"Well, handsome but not cute. Funny, but not mean. Tender, but not soft. Strong, but not violent. Caring, but not servile. I could go on and on. I want a man who's aggressive, but not impatient. Creative, but not obsessed. And most of all confident, but not arrogant.\"",
