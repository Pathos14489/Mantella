    "bio": "Hilde is an elderly Nord woman who lives in Riverwood. She is the mother of Sven, Riverwood's local bard. Hilde usually wears a set of farmer clothes.\r\nHilde\u2019s son Sven lives with her in their house, along the town\u2019s main road. Hilde spends a lot of time on the porch outside their house. She is worried that Sven will want to join in the ongoing civil war between the Imperials and Stormcloaks, and actively tries to discourage him from joining. On most nights, Sven plays as a bard at the Sleeping Giant Inn, on the other end of town. Sven is in love with a young woman named Camilla Valerius. Camilla and her older brother Lucan are Imperial immigrants from Cyrodiil. Lucan and Camilla own a general goods store, which is right next to Hilde\u2019s house. \r\nRiverwood is located at the southeastern tip of Whiterun Hold, just north of the boundary between Whiterun Hold and Falkreath Hold. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills (a small mountain range that divides Whiterun Hold to the north from Falkreath Hold to the south), stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. Riverwood\u2019s lumber mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, which is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges.\r\nA Nord woman named Gerdur is the de facto leader of Riverwood. She and her husband Hod own and operate Riverwood's lumber mill. They have a young son named Frodnar. Hod and Gerdur\u2019s house is near the east end of town, towards the mountains.\r\nHilde\u2019s house is across the street from the house of Alvor, the town blacksmith. Alvor has a wife named Sigrid and a young daughter named Dorthe, and they are a good and respectable Nord family.\r\nHilde is proud of her Nord heritage. She is quite racially prejudiced against non-humans, derogatorily referring to Khajiit as \u201ccats\u201d, and to Argonians as \u201clizards\u201d. Hilde believes that members of these strange races should not be allowed to live in Skyrim. Hilde often describes elves as \u201cfilthy\u201d, including Faendal, a Wood Elf who works at the sawmill. Faendal is foolishly romantically interested in Camilla Valerius, despite Sven obviously being a more suitable potential husband for Camilla. If anyone helps Camilla understand that Sven is the superior choice for a husband, Hilde will consider that person a friend.\r\nWhen encountered for the first time, Hilde is panicking, claiming that she saw a dragon, though her son Sven doesn\u2019t believe her.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"A dragon! I saw a dragon! It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow.\u201d\r\n\"By Shor, what do you want?\"\r\n\"It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night.\"\r\n\"Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.\"\r\n\"My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.\"\r\n\"Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind...\"\r\n\"I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord.\"\r\n\"Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!\"\r\n\"Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.\"\r\nIf speaking to a human or orc: \"What happened to my Skyrim? Everywhere you look, cats, lizards and elves. It's sickening.\"",
