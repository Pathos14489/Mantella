    "bio": "Wyndelius Gatharian, a Dunmer, is a tomb robber who now resides in Shroud Hearth Barrow, just outside the town of Ivarstead. He is a skilled mage, particularly with Destruction magic.\r\nSome time ago, Wyndelius journeyed into the barrow in search of the Sapphire Dragon Claw. As he wanted to stay within the barrow, he fooled the villagers into believing the barrow was haunted by rattling some pots to scare them away. The barrow's \"haunted\" reputation gave Wyndelius an idea to create a potion that would make him appear like a ghost, and further used this to continue to frighten the villagers. However, he soon grew mad, possibly as a side effect of the potion, and eventually began believing that he was the guardian of the barrow.\r\n\r\nWyndelius warns anyone intruding into the barrow to leave at once.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Leave this place... Leave this place...\"\r\n\"Leave... Leave... Leave...\"",
