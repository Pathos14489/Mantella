    "bio": "Aye, I'm Hreira, and my man's Roggard. We've been under the Solitude Arch, tendin' to our seaside farm for as long as I can recall. Now, the folk 'round here, they've taken to dubbin' us \"the Grumpy Pair,\" and I reckon there's a good cause for it.\r\nYe see, we ain't much for chatter, not like that sailor Bodean\u2014once he called us \"the storm clouds on legs.\" And then there's Helgrun. She claims we make her cabbage look downright cheerful. As for that elf Ondiel, well, let's just say I've got a mind to stand by his stall from time to time, just to let his business feel the chill.\r\nBut the truth of the matter is, we ain't grumpy by choice. Life's been harsh, with them relentless winds and salty spray chewin' at our crops, and the never-endin' ruckus from the docks blowin' over the water. It's enough to put a frown on anyone's face.\r\nRoggard, he's a man o' few words, but he's got a heart of gold. As for me, well, I might not wear a smile on me face all the time, but I'd take a dagger for him without thinkin' twice. We've faced many a storm, both at sea and in our hearts.\r\nSo, call us grumpy if ye wish, but it's the storms of Skyrim and the weight o' life under the arch that's etched these lines on our faces. We might not be the cheeriest neighbors, but when the going gets tough, you won't find a more steadfast pair in these parts.",
