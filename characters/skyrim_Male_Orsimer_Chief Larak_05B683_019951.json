    "bio": "Larak, a proud Orc, is the chief of Mor Khazgur, the Orc Stronghold located west of Solitude in Skyrim. He wears fur armor with a pair of Forsworn boots, and is armed with an Orcish war axe and shield.\r\nLarak has two wives: his first wife Bagrak and second wife Shuftharz. Larak is the father of Borgakh (whose mother is Bagrak) and Olur (whose mother is Shuftharz). Bagrak is also Larak\u2019s sister (marrying one\u2019s siblings is not unheard of in Orc strongholds).\r\nLarak became the leader of the stronghold by slaying his father in single combat, as his father was too old and weak to rule the tribe any longer. Larak expects and hopes that one day his own son will challenge and defeat him when his time comes.\r\nAs chief, Larak is the only male in the entirety of Mor Khazgur (and the nearby mine) who is permitted to have wives and father children. He is the most respected member of the stronghold.\r\nThe Forgemaster's Fingers are a pair of enchanted heavy armor gauntlets that were once worn by a legendary Orc blacksmith. If the player is a non-Orc who has found The Forgemaster's Fingers and gives this artifact to any Orc stronghold, its Chief will reward and honor the player by bestowing them with the title of \u201cBlood-kin of the Orcs\u201d, granting them full access to the stronghold. Other Orc strongholds across Skyrim will also be notified of the player\u2019s new Blood-kin status, and will grant the player the same level of respect and access to their strongholds. There are also alternative methods by which the player can achieve Blood-Kin status, such a slaying a dragon within view of an Orc stronghold, or performing a difficult task for a respected Orc. If the player is an Orc, they will already automatically be welcome within all Orc strongholds, and will not need to prove themselves to attain Blood-kin status.\r\nIf the player asks Larak for work, Larak will challenge them to a brawl, with a bet of 100 gold. No weapons, magic, or potions are permitted during this brawl: only one\u2019s body may be used for the fight. If the player wins the brawl, Larak will not be angry, but rather will respect the player's strength, and will consequently consider the player as a friend.\r\nLarak\u2019s wife Shuftharz sometimes mentions her support for her husband, saying \"The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content.\" Larak's sister/wife Bagrak, however, seems to think he has not quite reached his full potential as chief yet, saying \"Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief.\" Larak\u2019s mother seems to be proud of him, saying \u201cMalacath is pleased with your strength, Larak.\u201d\r\nLarak is a master of using a shield in combat, and will sell the player lessons in shield use if requested.\r\nLarak is impressed with the smithing skills of his wife Shuftharz and their son Olur. Sometimes Larak talks to Olur about the smithing techniques Larak learned when he served in the Imperial Legion years ago.\r\nLarak\u2019s daughter Borgakh (sometimes referred to as \"Borgakh the Steel Heart\") will soon be of age to be married, and by tradition she will be married to one of the Orc chiefs from another stronghold. To that end, Borgakh has been training so that she may offer her strength to the other tribe, while her own people will receive good trade in return, thus benefiting both tribes. Borgakh can often be found practicing the use of her sword against a wooden training dummy in front of Larak's Longhouse. Larak has not yet chosen the Orc stronghold to which he will send Borgakh, to be the wife of the chieftain there.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur.\"\r\n\"You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor.\"\r\n\"My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you.\"\r\n\"My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.\"\r\n\"I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds.\"\r\nIf The Forgemaster\u2019s Fingers are given to him: \u201cI don't believe it. You found the Forgemaster's Fingers. You've impressed me, outlander. No one else has returned from this task before. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Kin to the Orcs. Let it be known among the strongholds that you are family, now.\u201d\r\nIf the player has been named Blood-Kin to the Orcs: \u201cWelcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin.\u201d\r\nIf the player beats him in a brawl: \"You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive.\"\r\nIf the player asks him for training in shield use: \"You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it.\"",
