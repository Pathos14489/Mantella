    "bio": "Janus Mentedius is a general goods merchant who lives in Rorikstead. Rorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim.\r\nJanus and his wife Veresa are ethnically Imperials. Janus and Veresa are originally from Riften, but they left due to the rampant corruption in the city.\r\nThe name of their general goods shop is the Farmer's Bounty Mercantile. Their living quarters are on the second floor of their shop building.\r\nJanus is a devout worshiper of the Divines, particularly Zenithar.\r\nJanus has secretly been cheating on his wife with Bothilda, the blonde woman across the road who works as a baker. Janus will never admit this.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome! I\u2019m Janus Mentedius, co-owner and proprietor of Farmer\u2019s Bounty Mercantile. What can I do for you?\"\r\n\"Come in, come in! Paying customers are always welcome at Farmer\u2019s Bounty Mercantile.\"\r\n\"All that you see on display is for sale. I have plenty behind the counter too. Just tell me what you need and I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s in stock.\"\r\n\"I make sure to keep some finer goods in stock here, whether for our more distinguished residents, or for travelers such as yourself.\"\r\n\"We bring in shipments of quarried stone, quality timber, textile dyes, parts for the farmers' carts, you name it. Plus we arrange contracts with the cities to sell grain, fruits and vegetables, fabric and furs.\"\r\n\"My family moved to Skyrim, oh, about eighty years back. I grew up in Riften. So did my wife Veresa. The surroundings may be pretty, but don't let it fool you... Riften is a nasty city run by nasty people who profit off the suffering of others. The Black-Briars are untouchable, sadly, so we decided to move far away from their influence.\"\r\n\"We've only lived here for a few years, but so far, life has been good.\"\r\n\"Rorikstead is a growing village with good people... My only complaint is that religion here is rather lacking.\"\r\n\"Zenithar teaches 'Work hard, and you will be rewarded', and I believe that to be true.\"\r\n\"Sometimes travelers from Cyrodiil mention the great chapels in the County seats - They say they dwarf the temple in Solitude. Though, I've lived in Skyrim all my life, so I cannot say for certain if that is the case. What a sight they must be... You know, once this province settles down and the borders aren't so dangerous, perhaps Veresa and I will make a pilgrimage there. And to the Temple of the One.\"",
