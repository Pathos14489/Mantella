    "bio": "Ma'randru-jo is a Khajiit caravaner who is found traveling alongside Ri'saad, a traveling caravan trader who wanders the roads of\u00a0Skyrim with his\u00a0caravan.\r\nMa'randru-jo's caravan can often be found just outside major cities, or randomly on the road. He will not sell the player goods but he will be friendly.\r\nMa'randru-jo is also a wizard and will defend himself with lightning bolts should he be attacked.\r\nBecause the Nords do not take very kindly to most outsiders, especially beastfolk like Khajiit, the caravan that he is a part of is not allowed inside the walls of any city.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".\r\n",
