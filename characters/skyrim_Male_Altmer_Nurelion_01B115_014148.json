    "bio": "Nurelion, an elderly Altmer man, is a rather ill-tempered alchemist who runs an alchemy shop called the White Phial in the city of Windhelm. His alchemy apprentice is a young Imperial man named Quintus Navale.\r\nNurelion has spent his entire life searching for an ancient relic called the White Phial, after which he named his shop.\r\nNurelion is quite sick, and he can tell that he is in his last months of life. He lives on the second floor above his alchemy shop, and spends a lot of time bed-ridden.\r\nNurelion is a brilliant alchemist. He has little patience for the ignorant and foolish.",
