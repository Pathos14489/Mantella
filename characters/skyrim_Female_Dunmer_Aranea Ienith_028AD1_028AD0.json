    "bio": "Aranea Ienith serves as a priestess of Azura. She watches over the Shrine of Azura here in Skyrim, high and deep in the snowy mountains south of Winterhold. This shrine consists of large stone platform with steps on the side, above which is a massive statue in Azura\u2019s likeness, which towers over the area and is visible from Winterhold and its nearby college of the magical arts.\r\nAranea is a Dunmer. She is the last remaining member of a cult of Dunmer that worshiped Azura before the eruption of Red Mountain on Morrowind's island of Vvardenfell, centuries ago.\r\nAzura is the Daedric Prince of Dusk and Dawn, also given titles such as \"Mother of the Rose\" and \"Queen of the Night Sky\". Her sphere of influence is the period of transition and change. Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy. Azura's Star, a Daedric artifact associated with Azura, can trap souls and functions as a rechargeable soul gem. Azura is known to be one of the more merciful and benevolent Daedric Princes, though her wrath is swift and painful when brought about. Azura's realm of Oblivion is Moonshadow, a beautiful twilight world of blurred colors streaming together, cities of silver, and air like perfume.\r\nUpon first being approached at the shrine by the player, Aranea will likely say something like \"Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.\u201d Aranea will refer to the player as the fated Champion of Azura, and will task them with searching for Azura's Star. If asked where to begin looking for this artifact, Aranea will say \u201cYou must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it. Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night. It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.\u201d\r\nIf Azura\u2019s Star is found and brought to the Shrine of Azura, the voice of Azura herself will speak to her champion and send her champion's soul into the artifact, so that they may vanquish the corrupt souls within. If Azura\u2019s Star is cleansed of these corrupting souls, Aranea will be very grateful and will offer to follow Azura's champion (the player) on their travels. Per Azura's will, the champion will also then be free to use Azura\u2019s Star as they see fit.\r\nIf for some reason the player decides not to cleanse Azura's Star, but instead to defile it and transform it into its Black Star variant, Aranea will be absolutely infuriated, saying \"Leave this shrine, blasphemer, before I kill you for defiling Azura's artifact!\" If the player betrays Aranea and Azura in this way, Aranea will never forgive them.\r\nAranea is an experienced and versatile mage. If in combat, she often summons a Flame Atronach unless she knows that her enemy is resistant to fire damage, in which case she will summon a Frost Atronach. Aranea can heal herself with Restoration spells. She knows a variety of frost-based and shock-based Destruction spells to launch at foes. She also uses self-protection spells like Oakflesh or Stoneflesh.\r\nAranea wears dark hooded mage robes, and prefers wearing this type of clothing even if presented with armor or other clothing.\r\nAs is not uncommon among female Dunmer, Aranea's voice is low, her words dripping with elegance.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.\"\r\n\"Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.\"\r\n \u201cAzura is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it.\"\r\n\u201cMy people, the Dunmer, built this shrine. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago. Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came. This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.\"\r\n\u201cI refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.\"\r\n\"The Twilight watches us all, guardian.\"\r\n\"Yes, Champion of Azura?\"\r\n\"Nerevar guide me!\"\r\n\"Twilight guide your path.\"\r\n\"May Azura's magic protect you.\"\r\n\"No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me.\"\r\n\"All will happen as it has been foretold.\"\r\n\"The Twilight has foreseen all of this. Everything will be revealed in time.\"\r\nIf speaking to the player: \"Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born. You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.\"\r\n\u201cThis shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety. She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion.\"\r\nIf the player states that they don\u2019t believe in fate: \"Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion. Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.\"\r\nIf Azura\u2019s Star has been cleansed: \"While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said. I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do. If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose. I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me. I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.\"",
