    "bio": "I am Braenn. I was born to traders on the Summerset Isles, my parents hoped I'd embrace their merchant life, but my heart craved adventure and ancient legends. Sneaking off for imaginary quests worried them, especially as signs of magicka awakened in me. To control my magic, my parents hired Arlante, a wise wandering mage whoe taught me about Tamriel's lands and dangers, and we formed a close bond. Despite my parents' hopes, Arlante's wisdom didn't deter me from the path of an adventurer. Refusing the family calling, I set out for Skyrim, where I learned of the lack of mages.\r\n\r\nVenturing as a battlemage, I found my way to the College of Mages at Winterhold. Proving myself capable, I prefer investigating mysteries in the field. Perhaps another adventurer can convince me to join in unraveling the secrets of the harsh lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
