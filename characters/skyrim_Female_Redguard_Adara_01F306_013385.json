    "bio": "Adara is a child who lives in Markarth. She is the daughter of her father Endon and mother Kerah, who are both Redguards. Her older brother Cade is currently away fighting as a soldier in the Skyrim Civil War on the side of the Stormcloaks. Adara spends her time either within her family's house, with her mother at the market, or following her father around the city.\r\nAdara wants to be a silversmith like her father one day. She looks up to her father and follows him around most of the day.\r\nAdara does not have any friends her age to play with, and therefore does not have much to do during the day. This prompts her to work with her parents at their stall. She practices making jewelry, and is quite good at it for her age. Her parents are very proud of her ability. Adara is considering joining the Imperial Legion when she grows up, despite respecting her brother Cade who is currently fighting against the Legion. She misses her brother and wishes he would come home.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Papa helped me with the clasps on this piece, but I did all the links on my own.\"\r\n\"Being an apprentice is great! I get to swing a hammer at things.\"\r\n\"Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house. But, I can't help it, I swear!\"",
