    "bio": "The Alik'r Prisoner is member of the band of Redguard Alik'r warriors led by Kematu. He was sent to Whiterun by Kematu in order to capture a Redguard woman named Iman and bring her back to Hammerfell, to answer for the betrayal of her people to Aldmeri Dominion. However, while sneaking into the city, he was caught by the Whiterun Guard and sent to Dragonsreach Dungeon.\r\nWhen he is being interrogated by the player, he will require his bail to be paid as a pre-requisite to revealing any information about Kematu. 100 gold will need to be paid to the guard in the dungeon in order to clear the prisoner's fines and set him free. Once his fine is paid, the Alik'r prisoner will then reveal that Kematu is hiding at Swindler's Den, to the west across the plains of Whiterun.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cLet's talk about how we can help each other. \"You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know.\"",
