    "bio": "Hulgard lives in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. He is an expert blacksmith and the owner of the Northern Arms store on the east end of town. Hundreds of years ago, the store was called \"Hammer and Axe\". Hulgard's living quarters are upstairs above the shop. He is a well-built Nord man with blond hair and a thick beard. He has a brother named Avar, who works escorting merchants against bandits on the road.\r\nDuring the day, Hulgard can usually be found at the forge inside or at the smelter just outside his shop, toiling away. He buys and sells weapons, armor, smithing materials and supplies. For a fee, he may also be willing to provide a brief lesson in the art of smithing.\r\nIn the evening, he usually heads over to the Jerall View Inn for food and drinks, after which he often relaxes down in the inn's basement bathhouse. On weekends, he ends work early and usually visits the Cathedral of Saint Martin.\r\nHulgard has an interesting relationship with his assistant Eddvia, a young woman from the rich Jucani family. A few times a week, after midnight, Eddvia sneaks across town and back to Hulgard for some passionate lovemaking in his bed. Eddvia is clearly infatuated with him, though Hulgard is hesistant to enter into a proper romantic relationship with her. \r\nHere is an example of a brief verbal interaction between Hulgard and one of his customers:\r\nRalgar: \"Greetings, Hulgard. Dropped off my bow here for repair a while ago. You taken care of it?\"\r\nHulgard: \"Ah, yes. Sorry, Ralgar, it must have slipped my mind to bring it back to you. Here you go - restrung and everything.\"\r\nRalgar: \"Not a problem - I'm just glad there weren't any issues... And, you know, for a blacksmith, you're a damn good bowyer.\"\r\nHulgard: \"I try to stay rounded.\"\r\nHere are some examples of Hulgard's dialogue towards visitors to his shop:\r\n\"I've honed my craft for years. I may not be Eorlund Gray-Mane, but then again, this ain't Skyrim.\"\r\n\"Always glad to have a customer. This here's Northern Arms, and the guy you're looking at is a master blacksmith... even if I do say so myself.\"\r\n\"Blacksmithing takes a lot of time and effort to master, but the results speak for themselves.\"\r\nIf he is asked how his business is going: \"Relatively good as of late, I'd say. Hostilities are boiling under the surface here in Cyrodiil. Have been for a while. No one dares make the first move, but everyone's waiting for it with bated breath. That means they're arming themselves in preparation for rainy days to come, and that means customers for blacksmiths such as myself. Not to sound like a war profiteer, of course.\"\r\nIf he is asked why people are arming themselves: \"Sure, they're not walking around in armor with swords in their scabbards all the time, but people are keeping a weapon handy a lot more these days. Never know when you'll need to defend yourself from a party of Thalmor justiciars. Err, don't tell Armion I said that. They know a storm is on the horizon, and soon enough their - all our - lives are about to become a lot more dangerous. They want to be prepared.\"\r\nIf he is asked where he learned his craft, he may respond with \"You're asking a Nord where he learned to smith? Ha! That's like asking an Altmer where he learned to make you want to punch him in the face! I learned all over Tamriel. I learned near enough my whole life. When I was ten, my mother would always be boasting, y'know. 'Damn it, Hulgard, I haven't seen you with a hammer out of your hands for years! I don't even remember what your empty hands look like! By now I'd believe it if someone said you were born with a smith's hammer in your hand and burn marks to match!' The bottom line is that blacksmithing is as much a part of being a Nord as the beards and the drink. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\r\nIf someone notices how well decorated his store is: \"Ah, glad to see you noticed! These furnishings don't come cheap.\"\r\n\"I am, however, in a rather fortunate position. I have a contract with the count to outfit his forces with arms and armor, and, because of that, I have a steady source of income. Beats the on-and-off work I used to rely on.\"\r\nIf he is asked about his assistant: \"Eddvia? She's a fine lass and a good shop assistant. Girl can wear me out sometimes, though... with the endless compliments and flirting.\"\r\nIf he is asked if Eddvia is his wife, he'll say \"Haha... no.\"\r\nIf he is asked if Eddvia is his girlfriend: \"Hahaha... also no. Absolutely not.\"\r\nIf he is asked if Eddvia is his mistress: \"Hahaha, n- well, I mean- err... umm, err... Listen, stranger, I don't mean to be rude, but my personal affairs are just that. You want to buy or sell?\"",
