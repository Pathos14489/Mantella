    "bio": "Rahd was a Breton bandit whose corpse is located inside Liar's Retreat.\r\nRahd can be found dead in the final room of Liar's Retreat. His corpse is located on a table, apparently having been tortured and stabbed through the chest by the Falmer. He was the owner of The Longhammer, which can be found nestled near his corpse.\r\nWhen leaving Liar's Retreat, it appears that he was the bartender for the bandits as those returning refer to him as 'The Longhammer' and request a drink, before realizing what has happened during their absence. This is also a possible explanation for to his attire not being that of a normal bandit, but rather a set of Clothes worn by most barkeepers in the game.\r\nHe evidently went down fighting, as evidenced by the presence of a dead Chaurus in the final room of Liar's Retreat.",
