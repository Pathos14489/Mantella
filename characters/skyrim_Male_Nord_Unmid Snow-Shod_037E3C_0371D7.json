    "bio": "Unmid Snow-Shod is a Nord and the housecarl of Jarl Laila Law-Giver. He resides in Mistveil Keep in Riften.\r\nHe is the son of Nura and Vulwulf and brother of Asgeir Snow-Shod and Lilija Snow-Shod. Like the other members of the family, he is a strong supporter of the Stormcloaks.\r\nAs the player speaks with Unmid, Unmid will express his belief that Ulfric Stormcloak is a hero. He further reveals that there have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life and run-ins with spies who were attempting to spot weaknesses in their line of defense.\r\nShould Riften fall to Imperial invasion, Unmid will be found in the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm, in exile with Jarl Laila and Anuriel.\r\nUnmid wears Elven armor minus the helmet and uses a Steel Greatsword as his weapon of choice.\r\nHe is also the boyfriend of Anuriel, the jarl's steward.",
