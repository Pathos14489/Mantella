    "bio": "Hagravi Gray-Wave is a wandering storyteller who has reached the end of a long odyssey. Throughout his travels, he has met a number of odd characters, including the leader of the Forsworn, Madanauch. An amiable fellow, he and Dar\u2019Rakki will develop a friendship if the Khajiit\u2019s faith in humanity is reaffirmed. However, as an early character, much of his interaction with other NPCs are limited, as are his dialogue choices. As a child, he was teased due to the similarity his name bears to a Hagraven. Nevertheless, the name implies he once belonged to a clan despite being orphaned at a young age.",
