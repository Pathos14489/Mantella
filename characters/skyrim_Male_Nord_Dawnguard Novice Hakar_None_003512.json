    "bio": "Dawnguard Novice Hakar, a Nord man, is a novice member of the Dawnguard, an order of vampire hunters based at Castle Dawnguard, in the mountains at the southeastern tip of Skyrim.\r\nHakar repeatedly fails simple tasks given to him by his superiors. He has been given one last chance to redeem himself by restocking a number of Dawnguard caches throughout Skyrim.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJust now, Hakar was attacked by two vampires, but thankfully the player intervened and rescued him. If conversed with after being rescued, Hakar will express feeling terrified, and will exclaim that he is quitting the Dawnguard because he can't handle the pressure and the danger. Hakar will then drop all of his equipment, including his Dawnguard heavy armor, an Amulet of Stendarr, a key to Dawnguard caches, and a letter explaining orders from the Dawnguard. He will then flee towards\u00a0Frostfruit Inn\u00a0in\u00a0Rorikstead.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Gods, Vampires! I... I can't take this anymore! I'm not cut out for this!\"\r\n\"Look, take whatever you want. I'm getting out of here!\"",
