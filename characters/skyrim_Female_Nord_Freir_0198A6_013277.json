    "bio": "Freir is a Nord priestess of the Temple of the Divines.\r\nShe can be found in Solitude inside the temple, welcoming the visitors to the nine shrines. She may also be encountered if someone else from the temple is assaulted, coming to get an apology.\r\nSilana: \"Mistress, a word?\"Freir: \"Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?\"Silana: \"I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to.\"Freir: \"What could be more important than hearing the prayers of the faithful, and answering the questions of the dedicated?\"Silana: \"Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them.\"Freir: \"We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?\"Silana: \"I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more...\"Freir: \"Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it.\r\nRorlund: \"A word, my love?\"Freir: \"What troubles you, darling?\"Rorlund: \"I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?\"Freir: \"Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses.\"Rorlund: \"Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious.\"",
