    "bio": "Maven Black-Briar, a middle-aged Nord woman, is the matriarch of clan Black-Briar. She will become Jarl of The Rift if the Imperial Legion occupies Riften.\r\nMaven has strong ties with the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, making her the most influential person in Riften. When asked about her influence, Maven claims that she has Jarl Laila Law-Giver and the Riften Guard in her pocket. She is able to influence the outcome of any situation with money or by exploiting the fear that her allies will retaliate.\r\nAs the matriarch of the Black-Briar family, Maven is virtually unapproachable and elitist. She holds the actual pulse of Riften in her crushing grip and is not above using unscrupulous methods to ensure things go her way. Anyone who crosses her typically ends up dead or in prison; even members of her own family, such as her son Sibbi.\r\nShe can be found in various places about Riften, including the marketplace, Black-Briar Meadery, the Bee and Barb, and Black-Briar Manor.\r\nMaven is the mother of Hemming, Ingun, and Sibbi. Maul is her right-hand-man, and enforces her will in the city. Extremely subservient to Maven, Maul will do whatever she asks of him without question.\r\nMaven becomes Jarl if the Imperial Legion gains control of Riften. She will appoint Hemming as her steward and Maul as her housecarl. If the player sided with the Stormcloaks, but gave Riften to the Empire at the High Hrothgar peace summit then retakes it for the Stormcloaks later, Maven, Hemming and Maul will not be exiled; they will simply resume their daily routine. This is likely due to Maven's level of influence in Riften and the rest of Skyrim.\r\nIn Anuriel's chambers, a note from Maven reveals that she had her son Sibbi imprisoned for unknown reasons, writing that it is in his best interest to be kept under lock and key. He was arrested for \"airing out his family's dirty laundry\". Specifically, he killed his ex-fiance's brother after he was confronted about his affairs with other women.\r\nMaven may ask the player to find a quill that was lost by Vald.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf the player finds the Quill of Gemination. \"Really? I wrote that off a long time ago. Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain. Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.\"\r\n",
