    "bio": "Einvard is a student at the Bards College in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim. He is a young Nord man.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about himself: \"Solitude is where I call home now. I am learning my trade at the Bards College. Pretty fancy, huh? My family's in Falkreath though. I like to travel there as much as I can. Folks there could use some good cheers every now and then, what with that cemetery they all live right next to.\"\r\nIf asked his thoughts about Solitude: \"With all these guardsmen in fancy Imperial armor and walls as tall as giants, I think to myself everyday, this has got to be the safest place in all of Skyrim. Of course, then I remember that we're all standing on this pillar of rocks and there's nothing between us and the depths of the sea. And that's enough to tremble a grown man's heart. I am not good with high places.",
