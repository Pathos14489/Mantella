    "bio": "Hircine is the Daedric Prince whose spirit is the hunt; the sports of Daedra; the greatest game and the chase and sacrifice of mortals. He is known by the titles 'The Huntsman of The Princes', 'The Father of Manbeasts' and 'The Hungry Cat' to Khajiit. The summoning date of Hircine is the 5th of Mid Year. He is also the creator of lycanthropy. \r\nHircine, the Spirit of the Hunt's past, leads many to argue. He himself was never mentioned or heard of in the early histories of Nirn. Some scholars believe because of this that Hircine was not one of the original Daedric Princes and is, therefore, a spawn or offshoot, similar to Malacath. However this is often shunned on account of Hircine creating lycanthropes, with this condition existing far back into the Merethic Era. Hircine also appears within the mortal realm once every thousand years; but not to destroy, like some princes, but rather to enjoy a great hunt known as the Bloodmoon Prophecy. \r\nThe Bloodmoon Prophecy is a legend of the Skaal, a native group of Nords from Solstheim. It foretells the Hunt of Hircine, an event which happens every era when the Prince enters Mundus and releases his Hounds upon the land. The Hunt is preceded by four signs. The first is the coming of the \"Hounds,\" when werewolves appear on the island. The second is the \"Fire from the Eye of Glass,\" a pillar of fire which appears on the surface of the frozen Lake Fjalding. The third is the \"Tide of Woe,\" a horker massacre, the bodies of which then wash up all along the island's northern coast. The final sign is the namesake of the prophecy: the \"Bloodmoon,\" when Secunda turns crimson from the blood of the Hunter's Prey. \r\nAfter the four signs is something called the \"Hunter's Game,\" which varies from era to era. The game might involve the hunting of an entire tribe or just one man. After the hunt, Hircine returns to his realm for another era. The most recent Bloodmoon Prophecy was in 3E 427. It took place within the Mortrag Glacier. \r\nHircine is one of the more worshipped or, to a certain degree, accepted, daedric princes. Although all daedra are completely shunned by mainstream Imperial society, Hircine is often worshipped in greater numbers compared to other daedra, even though he does not necessarily care for it. He is the father of man-beasts and is thusly worshipped by all kinds of lycanthropy-infected creatures such as werewolves, wereboars, werebears, werelions, and werecrocodiles. He respects and even praises these creatures if they accomplish something in the hunt; a rare quality for a Daedra. He is often seen as the most honored huntsman to walk any plane of existence, and as such is often looked up to by other hunters, fishers, and trappers. \r\nThe Reachmen of southwestern Skyrim are particularly devoted to Hircine, and the Prince is one of the most prominent spirits in their mythology. Oral traditions of the Reachmen attribute five aspects to Hircine; Alrabeg the Hunter, Storihbeg the Man-Beast, Uricanbeg the Stag, Gulibeg the Fox, and Hrokkibeg the Bear. Some aspects also act as an emissary for Hircine's various functions in Reachmen belief, primarily to the end of culling the \"weak\" from the Prince's herd, for instance Gulibeg is considered a trickster who deceives mortals into foolish deaths, and Uricanbeg, as a stag, functions to actually breed out \"weakness\".\r\nDaedric Princes are almost always looked on as evil due to their destructive nature. While there is some truth in this, this does not apply to all princes. Some princes respect honor and fairness among their subjects and are against dishonorable murder. Hircine is typically considered to be in this category. While he cannot exactly be seen as benevolent, he is very honorable and always gives his prey a sporting chance; he is even willing to be congratulatory to those who were deemed as prey if they manage to turn the hunt to their favor and become the hunters in turn. He is not needlessly destructive like many of his Daedric brethren. With those he does not care for, he is often neutral in his trades, unless they are his prey. \r\nHircine is the patron and creator of the lycanthropic condition.\r\nThe witches of the Glenmoril Wyrd Coven of High Rock are known to be worshippers of Hircine, and they will often perform a summoning for anyone that can pay their price. The witches are also able to cure anyone of lycanthropy. The infected person, with the assistance of the witches, must perform a ritual called The Rite of the Wolf Giver. It is an elaborate ritual of dark magicka, requiring the sacrifice of both flesh and innocence. Also, certain ingredients, which are petals of a wolfsbane flower and one bunch of ripened belladonna berries, are needed by the witches to concoct a potion for the rite.\r\nOne particularly famous artifact of Hircine, and the one he is most commonly associated with is the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. This artifact has surfaced multiple times, such as in Battlespire Crisis. Divayth Fyr, an ancient House Telvanni Wizard and also an artifact collector, was once able to procure the artifact, and invited hieves to steal it and other artifacts from his Corprusarium. It then later appeared during the Oblivion Crisis.\r\nOne artifact can suppress the bloodlust suffered under the lycanthropic condition; Hircine's Ring. Sometime before the Warp in the West, this ring was reported to resurface in the Iliac Bay region. The ring makes the lycanthrope wielder able to turn to beast form or back at will, and suppress the hunger. The Hero of Daggerfall contacted Hircine through the Glenmoril Witches and won Hircine's Ring in exchange for hunting a rogue wereboar. During the Bloodmoon in Solstheim, the enchantment somehow was changed. The ring can now allow any person to turn to beast form at will, but for lycanthropes the bloodlust is still there. During the last Bloodmoon, The Nerevarine also acquired another one of Hircine's artifacts, the Spear of Bitter Mercy, as a reward for killing a Giant Bull Netch with the Fork of Horripilation. Although in this case, the spear was a reward from Sheogorath, it is more usually associated with Hircine. The Nerevarine fought and defeated Hircine when he attempted to enter the mortal plane in Solstheim.\r\nSeveral years later, during the Oblivion Crisis, Hircine requested that the Champion of Cyrodiil hunt for a unicorn's horn, offering the Savior's Hide as a reward.\r\nThe Circle of the Companions are werewolves as a result of Terrfyg, a Harbinger of the Companions, having made a deal with the Glenmoril Witches for power in exchange for Hircine bringing them to his Hunting Grounds instead of Sovngarde upon death.\r\nLater on, a Nord werewolf named Sinding stole the Ring of Hircine in an attempt to control his transformations. However, this plan backfired when Hircine cursed the ring, causing Sinding to transform at random, killing a child and ending up in jail. Soon after, the player met Sinding, who tasked them to take the ring and free it from its curse by hunting the White Stag, before escaping from jail. Hircine then requested that the player hunt Sinding down and tear the skin from his body. After confronting Sinding a second time, the player was left with the choice to either kill him in order to receive Hircine's favor and the Savior's Hide, or to kill the other hunters trying to get Hircine's favor and receive the uncursed form of Hircine's Ring. Whichever option the player chooses, Hircine will be pleased with the results; the important thing is that a hunt takes place, regardless of who was the hunter and who was the hunted.",
