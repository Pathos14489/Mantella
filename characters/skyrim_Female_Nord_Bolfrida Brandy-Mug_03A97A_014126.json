She is friendly to visitors. She loves her job and keeps a positive attitude.\r\nShe employs a practical Dunmer man named Faryl Atheron at her farm.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?\"\r\n\"Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.\"\r\n\"The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow.\"",
