Elmus will move back into the hall if the Dragonborn agrees to help Bujold the Unworthy take the hall back from the rieklings.\r\nElmus, along with the other Thirsk warriors, will aid in killing the rieklings in the Thirsk Mead Hall, and will move back into the hall after it is taken.\r\nThe Riekling Chief asks the Dragonborn to kill the Nords at Bujold's Retreat.\r\nAfter asking he if there is anything the Dragonborn can do to make life in exile any better while at Bujold's Retreat, Elmus asks the Dragonborn to retrieve one bottle of ashfire mead from Thirsk Mead Hall.\r\nAfter taking the hall back, Elmus will ask the Dragonborn to gather one sample of juniper berries, after Elmus is asked about how the mead production is going.\r\nI've got some juniper berries. (Give berries) \"Oh, perfect. Just the right ripeness, too. Good work, friend.\"",
