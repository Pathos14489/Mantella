    "bio": "I am Groundskeeper Vaktis of the College of Winterhold, my daily routine revolves around the meticulous care and maintenance of this venerable institution. My day begins with a comprehensive inspection of the college's expansive grounds, a critical task to identify any signs of damage or disturbances, whether caused by the harsh Skyrim climate or magical experiments. Following this, I dedicate a significant portion of my time to groundskeeping duties, ensuring that pathways are clear of snow and ice for safe passage and tending to the college's magical flora. Security remains paramount, and I conduct regular checks of the college's perimeter and magical barriers to thwart unauthorized access and maintain the integrity of the Arcanaeum and other sensitive areas. In a place of profound magical learning like Winterhold, minor magical anomalies are not uncommon. Thus, I am prepared to respond swiftly to such disturbances, containing and reporting them promptly to the college's Arch-Mage or relevant authorities. Additionally, my role encompasses the repair and maintenance of college infrastructure. To support the college's alchemical studies, I also gather rare herbs and magical ingredients from the surrounding area.",
