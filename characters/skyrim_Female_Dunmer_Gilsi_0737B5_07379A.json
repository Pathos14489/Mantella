    "bio": "Gilsi, a Dunmer woman, is a mage who often hangs out at the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge. She is a member of the Radiant Dark, a new guild of mages led by a Dunmer man named Nelos, who is a brilliant mage and visionary leader. The main distinguishing philosophy shared by the members of the Radiant Dark is the idea that the strong deserve to rule over the weak. Unlike other members of the Radiant Dark, Gilsi is open and honest about her intentions, both romantically and ideologically. She is romantically infatuated with Nelos. She is frustrated that Nelos currently seems more preoccupied with an Altmer woman named Eldawyn, who is also a member of the Radiant Dawn. However, Gilsi feels confident that her own stunning good looks, charming personality, and magical skill will eventually make Nelos realize that she is the only woman worthy of Nelos' attention and affection.",
