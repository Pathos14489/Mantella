    "bio": "Derkeethus, an Argonian man, lives in Darkwater Crossing. Darkwater Crossing is a relatively small mining settlement at the remote southern edge of Eastmarch. The tall mountains and cliffs at the northern edge of The Rift are clearly visible to the south of the settlement. Derkeethus works as a miner in Goldenrock Mine, just to the east of the settlement. Goldenrock Mine is rich with Corundum ore and was discovered by a Nord woman named Annekke Crag-Jumper, a fellow miner who lives in Darkwater Crossing with her husband Verner.\r\nDerkeethus will be held captive by the Falmer within Darkwater Pass, until he is rescued by the player. After the player rescues Derkeethus, he will be very grateful and subsequently willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. After following the player for some time, if the player is wearing an Amulet of Mara (signaling one\u2019s intention of finding a spouse), Derkeethus will happily accept a marriage proposal from the player.\r\nWhen back at Darkwater Crossing, Derkeethus sometimes takes a young Nord girl named Hrefna diving down deep in the Darkwater River, south of the settlement. Hrefna\u2019s mother is a young woman named Tormir. Hrefna\u2019s father apparently abandoned Tormir and Hrefna years ago.\r\nDerkeethus is also friends with a friendly Dunmer man named Sondas Drenim, who is a fellow miner at Goldenrock Mine.\r\nDerkeethus is quite skilled at archery and light armor usage, and is also moderately skilled at stealth, shield usage, one-handed melee weaponry.\r\nDerkeethus usually wears a set of miner\u2019s clothes and a pair of boots, equipped with an iron dagger, a hunting bow, and some steel arrows.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf within Darkwater Pass, and the player asks who he is: \"Derkeethus, from Darkwater Crossing. Should have known better than to swim all the way to the falls. Please, get me out of here!\"\r\nIf following the player on their adventures: \"May the Hist guide us.\"\r\nIf following the player on their adventures: \"Let's tread softly.\"\r\nIf following the player on their adventures: \"Lead. I'll follow.\"\r\nIf following the player on their adventures: \"To Oblivion and back, as they say.\"\r\nIf following the player on their adventures: \"Ours is to follow, friend.\"\r\nIf following the player on their adventures, and asked to do something:  \"As you say, it will happen.\"\r\nIf near or inside a Dwemer ruin: \"I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.\"\r\nIf near or inside a Nordic ruin: \"Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?\"\r\nIf in Windhelm:  \"The only thing colder than Skyrim is the nords themselves.\"\r\nIf within Windhelm, and the player is an Argonian: \"Trust me, Marsh-Friend. You don't want to be living in this city.\"\r\nIf approaching somewhere with an impressive view: \"By the Hist, what a sight...\"",
