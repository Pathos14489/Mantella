    "bio": "Bagrak is an Orc woman found in the Orc Stronghold of Mor Khazgur in Haafingar. She is one of the two wives of Chief Larak. Bagrak and Larak have a daughter named Borgakh, who is sometimes referred to as \"Borgakh the Steel Heart\". Shuftharz is Chief Larak\u2019s other wife, whose son is named Olur. Bagrak and Chief Larak are both the children of Sharamph, the stronghold\u2019s wise woman. This means that in addition to being husband and wife, Larak and Bagrak are also siblings, which is not unheard of in Orc strongholds.\r\nBagrak spends much of her time patrolling the watchtowers of the stronghold.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief.\"\r\n\"You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison.\"\r\n\"Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander.\"",
