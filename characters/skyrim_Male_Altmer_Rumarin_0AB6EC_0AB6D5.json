    "bio": "Rumarin is a jovial Altmer man. He is a professional adventurer, bladebinder and grave robber by his own admission. Much of Rumarin\u2019s personality is based on deflection and sarcasm, although he does demonstrate a visible resentment of mages. He talks with a dark sense of irony. His parents were troubadours, and he too was part of the troupe. They spent everyday around performers of all walks of life. He gravitated the most to a Jester named Otero, a man who got on better with children than adults because it is easier to make children laugh. The day Rumarin stopped wanting to be a jester, Otero had taken him aside to practice his new act. The act attracted some bandits, who mocked Otero. Otero killed them with a hidden blade, and Rumarin has since told people this is when he \"learned how disarming laughter really is\".",
