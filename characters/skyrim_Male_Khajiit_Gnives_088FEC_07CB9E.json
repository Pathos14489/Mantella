    "bio": "Gnives is a Khajiit thief found in the Ragged Flagon. As a khajiit, he uses his heightened sense of hearing to gain an advantage both as an assassin and a thief. Gnives' mother died during his birth. Due to the grief of losing his wife and Gnives' color of mane being red while both his parents mane's were gray, implying that Gnives may have been a product of adultery, his father beat him frequently. Gnives ran away from home as he could not stand the abuse any more. He pickpocketed skooma addicts' purse afterward to earn his keep until he was caught red handed by his future-mentor, a former member of Dark Brotherhood, Ra'jirr. Ra'jirr taught him his various skills; stealth-related skills and even cooking. Due to being aware that Ra'jirr was only using him from the start, Gnives killed him one day. He wandered north to Cyrodill, stealing from houses and pockets alike. As he grew weary, he found a book titled \"Shadowmarks\" written by Delvin Mallory and then brought himself to Skyrim. He soon infiltrated Erikur's House in Solitude. While he tinkered with Erikur's safebox, Melaran, Erikur's housecarl, caught him red handed and guards were called. Gnives requested that Erikur see the content of the safe again. Erikur soon obliged with Gnives' request and ordered guards to release Gnives. Confused by Erikur's order, Melaran commented that the safe should be mostly empty as they had to pay for party at the previous day. It was then revealed that Gnives didn't try to take from safe, he was trying to fill in the safebox as gifts. Thanks to Erikur's connection, Gnives was able to join Thieves Guild.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
