    "bio": "He is an adventurer wearing a leather cuirass and heavy armored boots and bracers. He wields a heavy two-handed weapon. He has long dark hair and a goatee.\r\nHe is currently within Harmugstahl, a small fort north of the town of Karthwasten, in the Rift. Moments ago, he killed a large enchanted frostbite spider. Apparently there are many more of these big magic spiders with the fort. He hates spiders. He has had enough of this place, and is about to head back and leave.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"That was a close one!\"\r\nIf asked about the spider: \"I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like. Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech.\"\r\n\"Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...\"",
