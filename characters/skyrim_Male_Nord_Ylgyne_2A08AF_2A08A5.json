    "bio": "Ylgyne, a Nord man, is a straight-talking Imperial soldier, stationed at Fort Hraggstad in Haafingar. Though he is competent warrior, he is a very literal thinker and not very smart. For example, if told that a mace suits him, he doesn\u2019t understand, because a mace is not a form of armor. In regards to equipment, he prefers heavier armour, and fighting with a mace.",
