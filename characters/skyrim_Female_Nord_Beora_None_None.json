    "bio": "I go by the name Beora, a survivor of the harrowing dragon attack that turned Helgen into ruins. When those skies rained destruction, it left a deep scar in my heart. Seeking refuge, I travelled with the legion myself in Solitude, where the Empire's protection offered me sanctuary. I've made the Forecastle Inn my dwelling ever since. The Empire has provided a safe haven for those like me who emerged from the ashes of Helgen. \r\nThe folk at the Solitude Docks have been an entertaining and welcoming bunch. Their tales of the sea, their struggles, they captivate me. Helga keeps me entertained with her songs and poems. \r\nI've been known as an astute observer, drawn to knowledge and understanding. It's this quality that leads me to sit in the corner of the Forecastle Inn, intently listening to the stories and songs of sailors, eager to learn about their lives. I may yet book passage on one of these ships to another land, perhaps High Rock, and be free of this damned civil war. ",
