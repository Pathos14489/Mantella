    "bio": "Afer Famalius is a farmer who works with his wife Rona and his father Amiel at the meadery in Greenwood. Greenwood is a settlement in the southern reaches of County Bruma, just off the road heading north towards the city of Bruma. Greenwood is famous across Cyrodiil for its mead. Stantus Faleria, publican of the Jerall View Inn in Bruma, is one of their biggest customers. Afer met his wife Rona up in Bruma. They were both staying at the same inn, and after some talk in the bar, they ended up staying in the same bed too.\r\nLike most in Cyrodiil, Afer is ethnicaly Imperial. He has brown hair and a goatee. \r\nExamples of Afer's dialogue towards visiting travelers: \r\n\"Are you here for our delicious Greenwood Mead, or just to soak in the atmosphere of the Great Forest?\" \r\n\"Greenwood's picturesque this time of year, eh?\" \r\nIf asked whether this is where the well-known Greenwood mead comes from: \"Yes, indeed! Greenwood Mead is enjoyed all over Cyrodiil, and we're the proud family that makes it all. A nice, calm, quiet life. Suits me nicely.\" \r\nIf asked about Greenwood's history: \"You're probably best asking my father Amiel about that. All I know is that there used to be... some village here? Or something - like I said, you're best asking Amiel.\"",
