    "bio": "Brenuin is a Redguard man who lives in Whiterun. He is a homeless beggar and drunkard, and wears a set of ragged robes.\r\nDuring the day, he can usually be found loitering in the Whiterun marketplace, asking for free food or money from merchants like Carlotta Valentia (an Imperial woman), Anoriath (a Bosmer man), and Ysolda (a young Nord woman). While begging for money, Brenuin will sometimes falsely refer to himself as a \"fellow Nord\" (despite being a Redguard, though he is particularly light-skinned for a Redguard), in an attempt to draw her sympathy. . Brenuin can also be found loitering around the Gildergreen, the tree at the center of the Winds District in Whiterun. At night, he often visits the Bannered Mare (the most popular inn in Whiterun, where a Nord woman named Hulda is the innkeeper) where Brenuin strolls around until he hits the streets again after midnight.\r\nBrenuin has recently been teaching an orphaned Imperial girl named Lucia how to be a beggar. Lucia says that Brenuin is the only person who cares for her.\r\nBrenuin may ask the player to steal a rare Argonian ale from the Bannered Mare and give it to him. If this ale is brought to him, he will reward the player with a healing potion and will then consider the player his friend. Brenuin will also consider the player his friend if they give him any money.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.\"\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\"Sure. Whatever.\"\r\n\"I don't owe you money, do I?\"\r\n\"What? Why you lookin' at me?\"\r\n\"I ain't done nothin'.\"\r\n\"Spare a coin for a fellow Nord who's down on his luck?\"\r\n\u201cGods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat.\"\r\n\"That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone.\"",
