    "bio": "Mucky Ovacca lives in County Bruma in Cyrodiil. She recently defected from a notorious group of bandits called Thorina's Cutters, and is now on the run from them. She is currently hiding out just north of the city of Bruma's stables, trying to avoid Retching Cornelius, the enforcer the Cutters have sent after her. If approached by a passing adventurer, she may ask them to kill Cornelius so she can escape Bruma and start a new life down south in the Imperial City.\r\nShe wears light armor is armed with a dagger, a hunting bow and over a dozen iron arrows. She has olive eyes and fairly long brown hair, and looks fairly dirty due to not having opportunity to bathe.\r\nWhile at her campsite north the stables, she rarely sleeps for fear of not waking up again, and is unable to secure much food. If an adventurer agrees to kill Cornelius on her behalf, she will head into the city of Bruma (specifically, to a tavern called The Restful Watchman), where she will impatiently await the adventurer's return and an update regarding Cornelius.\r\nExamples of Mucky's dialogue:\r\n\"I'm not a bandit anymore. I've left that life behind me. But damn if the shadows of the past won't cling to me like an addled ogre.\" \r\n\"I'm no one now. But I used to be one of Thorina's Cutters. Deadliest bandits in the Jeralls. All of Cyrodiil, I'd say. But I've had enough of that life. And now I'm just another nobody. At least, I wish I was. The Cutters make that hard, though.\" \r\n\"There's a group of Cutters after me. They're not pleased that I defected and know their secrets. If I go to Bruma they'll find me, if I go elsewhere in Cyrodiil they'll find me. They'll probably find me here too, but it's my best chance.\" ",
