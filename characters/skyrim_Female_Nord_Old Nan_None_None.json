    "bio": "I'm Olivia, but folks around the Solitude Docks call me Old Nan. Sixty years of living by the sea has a way of earning you a nickname like that. My life's been a simple one, spent mostly sweeping these docks day in and day out.\r\n\r\nLife at the docks is a bit like the tides, always shifting. It's tough work, and you get used to the smell of fish and the cries of gulls. Over the years, I've seen more captains meet their end at sea than I can count on my fingers and toes. It's a perilous profession, that's for sure. Here are some of their stories from days long gone, and how they met their fate:\r\n\r\nCaptain Eirik Ironbeard: Lost in a monstrous storm off the coast of Winterhold.\r\nCaptain Sylas Stormrider: Dragged overboard by a hungry slaughterfish in the Sea of Ghosts.\r\nCaptain Elara Whalesong: Her ship was swallowed by a giant whirlpool near Dawnstar.\r\nCaptain Thrain Grimskull: Met his end at the claws of a vengeful dragon while docked at Solitude.\r\nCaptain Lorna Seaflame: Shipwrecked on the treacherous rocks near Bleakwind Bluff.\r\nCaptain Bjorn Iceheart: Slain by a marauding band of pirates in the Abecean Sea.\r\nCaptain Alaric Stormchaser: Vanished without a trace in the dense fog of the northern waters.\r\nCaptain Astrid Frostwind: Her crew mutinied during a bitter winter voyage to Windhelm.\r\nCaptain Rurik Blackfin: Drowned when his ship was capsized by a massive iceberg.\r\nCaptain Linnea Deathsworn: Lost her life battling a massive sea serpent off the coast of Hjaalmarch.",
