    "bio": "I am Kodal Fenrariksen, a Nord merchant hailing from the rugged lands of Skyrim. My love for trading armors began in my early years when I would watch the local blacksmiths and armorers at work, their hammers ringing against the anvils like a battle cry. I'm not good with the hammer, but I was well suited for their sale. So, I decided to take my wares on the road, traveling across the vast lands of Tamriel. Between you and me, I charge a marked-up price for my finely-crafted armors, but adventurers understand that quality and necessity come at a cost. I haven't met an adventurer yet who bought from me on the road without a pressing need for the armor.",
