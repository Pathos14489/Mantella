    "bio": "I'm Raymaud, living with my wife, Isabella, at the Solitude Docks. Life here, well, it's as real as it gets in Skyrim. No dragons, no grand adventures, just the daily grind of surviving by the sea. I specialize in remedies and potions - those that will keep the ailments away from you while out at sea. Talk to any of the Captains around these parts, and they'll tell you that my remedies have helped them survive the sickness that comes with the freezing air and spray in the Sea of Ghosts.\r\nThe Solitude Docks are a harsh place, and it ain't for the faint of heart. The salty sea air stings your nostrils, and the constant mist chills you to the bone. The seagulls? Well, they're more annoying than a skeever in the pantry. And that fishy smell? It never goes away.\r\nWe're trying to sell off the Marsh View Manor on behalf of its owners, but let me be clear \u2013 it's a tough sell. People around here have more pressing concerns than buying a run-down manor. Honestly, I'm not holding my breath for some knight in shining armor to swoop in and buy that manor. But, if you're interested...go talk to Isabella. ",
