    "bio": "Seren is a Redguard woman from Hammerfell, where she used to live until she married a Nord man named Rustleif, who at the time was her father's smithing apprentice. Seren and Rustleif later moved to Dawnstar in Skyrim, where they now run a blacksmithing business.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nEven though Seren is now pregnant with their first child, she still helps her husband around the shop. Like Rustleif, she sells weapons and armor, and is also willing to buy used weapons and armor at a discount.\r\nSeren has not gotten used to Skyrim's frigid climate, and she misses her homeland of Hammerfell. She also worries about Skyrim's ongoing civil war between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak rebellion, and consequently thinks that Skyrim might not be the best place to raise their upcoming newborn child.",
