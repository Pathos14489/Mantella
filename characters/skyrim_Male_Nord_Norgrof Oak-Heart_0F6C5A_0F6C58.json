    "bio": "Norgrof Oak-Heart, a Nord man, is a nobleman. He lives in the city of Solitude. Norgrof recently attended a particularly bloody public execution that left his family cloak stained in blood, which Norgrof believes entitles him to compensation in the form of land. He is currently in the Blue Palace, demanding an audience with Jarl Elisif regarding his request for compensation.\r\nWhile generally surly, his disposition changes dramatically depending on the attire of the person with whom he is conversing. If someone is wearing fine clothes, Norgrof will address them as a peer.",
