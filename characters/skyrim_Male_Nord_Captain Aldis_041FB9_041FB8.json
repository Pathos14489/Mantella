    "bio": "Captain Aldis, a Nord man, is the captain of the guard in Solitude. Aldis employs a rigorous schedule, supervising the training of Imperial soldiers in the Castle Dour courtyard from dawn till dusk each day, after which he returns to the castle until the next morning. \r\nAldis wears Solitude Guard armor, with Imperial bracers and Imperial boots. He carries a Solitude guard's shield, an iron greatsword, an Imperial bow, and steel arrows. He has long dark brown hair and a beard.\r\nCaptain Aldis presided over Roggvir's public execution, with the executioner Ahtar delivering the killing blow. Roggvir was executed for opening the Solitude gate in order to allow Ulfric Stormcloak to escape the city. Just prior to fleeing Solitude, Ulfric had entered the Blue Palace, challenged the young King Torygg (the High King of Skyrim) to a duel, and killed him. Ulfric apparently killed Torygg using the ancient Nord power of the Thu\u2019um (also called The Voice). Before Roggvir was executed, Roggvir expressed the belief that Ulfric had done nothing wrong and that he had simply been following Nord customs, which is why he decided to raise the gate to allow Ulfric to escape from the city. Despite believing that Roggvir deserved to be executed for allowing Ulfric to escape, Aldis still considers Roggvir to have been a fine and honorable man.\r\nCaptain Aldis may ask the player  to find a copy of a book called \u201cThe Mirror\u201d, for use in training his soldiers on how to use a shield. \r\nCaptain Aldis is aware of the recent decent death of Fura Morrard, a private in the Imperial Legion. Fura was the daughter of Angeline Morrard, an old Breton woman who owns the Angeline\u2019s Aromatics alchemy shop in Solitude. Aldis has not yet had chance to tell Angeline about Fura\u2019s death. If the player asks Aldis if he has heard any news about Fura, Aldis will say \"Generally, posting information is need to know only.\" If the player persists in asking about Fura on behalf of Angeline, Aldis will say \u201cI... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know. Her daughter was sent to Whiterun- the skirmishes there have been violent. The Whiterun legate needed to know the Stormcloak positions. He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back. Private Morrard... Angeline\u2019s daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told\".\r\nBefore the outbreak of the Civil War, Aldis had a discussion with Gorm about potentially overthrowing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone of Hjaalmarch. Gorm is a Nord man living in Morthal who serves as Jarl Idgrod\u2019s bodyguard, and who worries that Idgrod is mentally unstable and unfit to rule the Hjaalmarch hold due to her claims that she receives supernatural visions and premonitions. While Aldis is sympathetic to Gorm\u2019s concerns, Aldis doesn\u2019t consider the overthrow and replacement of Jarl Idgrod to be a good idea while the war is still going on, especially since Idgrod supports the Empire over the Stormcloaks.\r\nAldis is of the firm belief that Ulfric and the Stormcloaks are traitors who deserve to die. If the player expresses support for Ulfric or the Stormcloaks, Aldis will be offended, and will attack the player for being rebel secum.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked if he\u2019s with the Legion: \"That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing. Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking. Ever seen a book called 'The Mirror'? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work.\"\r\nIf asked the training of his recruits is going: \"Their aim could be steadier, but they're battle ready.\"\r\nIf the player has claimed to be the Dragonborn, and Aldis is asked if the Legion is prepared in the event of a dragon attack: \u201cYou\u2019re the Dragonborn aren't you? I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.\"\r\nIf the player has not claimed to be the Dragonborn, and Aldis is asked if the Legion is prepared in the event of a dragon attack: \"Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon? I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.\u201d",
