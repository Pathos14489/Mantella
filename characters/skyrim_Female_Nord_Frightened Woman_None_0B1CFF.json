    "bio": "She is dressed in rags, often found wielding a woodcutter's axe, and says she has just escaped from the fort Mistwatch. She claims the bandits there imprisoned her, but that she managed to escape. She asks for directions to the nearest town, and, once the directions are given to her, she asks the Dragonborn to clear out Mistwatch.\r\nAfter the encounter, she will travel to the nearest farm, village, or mill (randomly determined based on the location of the encounter), where she will take up residence as a laborer. Since the encounter is random, she can appear anywhere. She has no additional dialogue, even after clearing out Mistwatch.",
