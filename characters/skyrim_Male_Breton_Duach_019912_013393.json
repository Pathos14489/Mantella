    "bio": "Duach is a Breton Reachman and a prisoner in the north end of Cidhna Mine.\r\nHe was arrested seven years ago, when a Forsworn raid he was involved in went bad.\r\nWhen imprisoned in Cidhna Mine, The Dragonborn can talk to Duach about the skooma, but only if they talked to Grisvar the Unlucky first, about getting a shiv.\r\nWhen talking to him, the Dragonborn has a chance to persuade Duach or brawl him for the skooma, which they can give to Grisvar in exchange for a shiv or to Borkul the Beast so he will let the Dragonborn pass. Another way to get the skooma is to pickpocket it from Duach.",
