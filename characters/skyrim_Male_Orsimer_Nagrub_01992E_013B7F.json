In the future, he hopes to fight his brother Umurn and his father for the stronghold's leadership.\r\nNagrub: \"Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make.\" Arob: \"Patience, my son. The hunter does not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it.\"",
