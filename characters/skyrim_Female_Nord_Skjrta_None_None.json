    "bio": "I'm Skjrta, and I live at the docks in Solitude with my mum, Helgrun, and my dad, Bodean. My dad's a sailor, so he's always goin' out to sea. My dad, well, he talks kinda gloomy when he's talkin' 'bout sailin'. He says the sea can be a real tough place, with big storms and all. Sometimes, he says it's like the sea's tryin' to swallow him up. \r\nLife here's fun, 'cause I get to play by the water and watch the big ships. Sometimes, I help mum sell the fish she catches or the wheat she grows. She's a great person and she teaches me how to catch 'em too.\r\nI love when the sailors come back to the docks. They bring all sorts of cool stuff from their travels. One time, a sailor gave me a shiny seashell, and I keep it in a special place in my room.\r\nThe Forecastle Inn is nearby, and sometimes, mum takes me there for a treat. She says Hilda sings the most beautiful songs, and I love listenin' to her. The inn smells like warm bread and mead, and it's cozy inside.\r\nI've got some friends who live here too. Brandel Green-Beard is fun. We play hide-and-seek among the crates and barrels, and sometimes, we pretend we're pirates lookin' for buried treasure. We're told to not wander too far north though. There are bad people beyond the gate. Or so I'm told. Sometimes I can sea their rundown green ship.",
