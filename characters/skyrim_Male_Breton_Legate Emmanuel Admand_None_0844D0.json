    "bio": "Legate Emmanuel Admand, a Breton man, is an officer in the Imperial Legion, commander of the Imperial forces stationed within The Reach. He has green eyes, balding blonde hair, and a beard. He wears a set of Imperial armor with a matching pair of boots and bracers. In close combat, he relies on an Imperial sword or a steel dagger. He uses an Imperial bow for ranged combat if needed, with steel arrows as ammunition.\r\nLegate Admand is stationed within Understone Keep in Markarth (the capital of The Reach). Understone Keep is an ancient Dwarven keep built into the mountainside, used as a palace by the Jarl of Markarth. The current Jarl is Igmund (a Nord man), who is attended by Steward Raerek (an old man who is also Igmund\u2019s uncle) and Housecarl Faleen (a Redguard woman). Igmund has aligned himself with the Imperial Legion.\r\nThe Thalmor Justiciar Ondolemar and his Thalmor soldiers are also stationed within Understone Keep, in order to observe and prevent any kind of Talos worship, in accordance with the White-Gold Concordat. Admand has no love for Ondolemar or the Thalmor, but he nonetheless carries out the orders from his superiors in the Legion to comply with Ondolemar\u2019s inspections.\r\nIf the Stormcloak rebels take control of Markarth, Admand will be forced to relocate his base of operations to the Reach Imperial Camp in the northern part of The Reach near the Druadach Mountains, which form the border between Skyrim and High Rock.\r\nIf asked, Admand will tell you how to join the Imperial Legion. Since the Empire\u2019s forces are spread thin, the Legion has been forced to recruit locally.\r\nAdmand is an avid supporter of the Empire, and he will state that it is the Legion\u2019s duty to protect the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the Empire's citizens. He is strongly against the Stormcloak rebellion.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The Legion's always looking for strong, capable warriors. If you think you've got what it takes, our headquarters is in Solitude.\"\r\n\"Can't wait to kill another of Ulfric's boys.\"\r\nIf asked how he feels about the war: \"You mean Ulfric's so-called \u2018Stormcloak rebellion\u2019? The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, \u2018Jarls\u2019 - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order. Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally. But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.\"\r\n\u201cThe Legion's always been in Skyrim. We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry. Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.\u201d\r\nIf asked how to join the Imperial Legion: \"Think you've got the mettle, eh? Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess. If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tullius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim. But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.\"",
