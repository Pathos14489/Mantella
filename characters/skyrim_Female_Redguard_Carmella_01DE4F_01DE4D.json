    "bio": "Carmella, a Redguard woman, is an artist who uses necromancy as her brush. She tries to shock her audience to elicit more natural emotions, and from their reactions find varying interpretations of the piece. In addition to her visual art, Carmella is also a fan of asks hypothetical questions o learn more about people. If one describes her work as \"necromancy\" instead of \"necromantic art\", she will reply in a negative and condescending way, as she holds the distinction between the two very important. She trained at the College of Winterhold, where necromancy is legal and accepted, but unfortunately only for research and study. The college does not support the use of necromancy for art, and this fallout is what caused Carmella to leave the college. The only thing Carmella misses from the college were the bright minds around her during her time there. Otherwise, she is thrilled to no longer be stifled by their rules. She can often be found in the hilly area just south of the road that runs south of Lake Ilinalta, where she artistically and magically manipulates a group of skeletons.",
