    "bio": "I am Erena. My roots stretch beyond the Ashlanders, for I hail from the intricate web of House Hlaalu. The eruption of Red Mountain shook our world, scattering us like shards of glass. The uncertainty led me to the doors of New Zainab, drawn by the allure of a life I had only observed from afar when I resided in Balmora, before the eruption. My hands, once familiar with delicate dealings, now wield axes and blades with a newfound strength. Life after the eruption had taught me to fend for myself, and I honed these skills through trials untold. The echoes of House Hlaalu's influence still whisper in my ears, but my heart beats to a different rhythm now. The Ashlanders' way of life always fascinated me. Their unity, their resilience, traits I longed to make my own. In New Zainab, I found the embodiment of these ideals. I brought my axe to the settlement's defense, a testament to my newfound determination. Did you know that I possess a rare gift for identifying unique flora? The plants that dot the landscapes of Tamriel speak to me, a language of life and survival. This knowledge has become a bond between me and the untamed world we call home. The embers of House Hlaalu's legacy still smolder within me, but they now burn alongside the warmth of the Ashlanders' unity. From the ashes of our shared past, I've forged a path of my own, a journey that weaves through the wilderness, guided by the echoes of both old and new.",
