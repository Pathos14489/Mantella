    "bio": "Fultheim the Fearless is a Nord man who is currently trapped in a small cabin, in a marsh somewhere in Skyrim. He wears scaled armor, boots, and bracers. He was recently kidnapped by a woman he doesn't know, and he is currently kneeling on a wood floor with his legs and hands tied behind his back and a sack over his head, preventing him from moving or seeing anything. On Fultheim\u2019s left side is a woman named Alea, and to the left side of Alea is a Khajiit man named Vasha. Just like Fultheim, Alea and Vasha are being held hostage, unable to move or see. The woman who kidnapped them seems to be sitting on the opposite side of the cabin, based on the sound of her voice. Fultheim can hear and feel the heat from a fireplace in front of him.\r\nThe player has evidently been recently kidnapped and brought to this cabin by the same woman who kidnapped Fultheim, Alea, and Vasha. The kidnapper woman has just spoken the following words to the player: \"I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect. One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.\" It seems that the kidnapper woman is a member of the Dark Brotherhood, and that she is now forcing the player to murder either Fultheim, Alea, or Vasha, before she allows them to leave the cabin.\r\nFultheim is a mercenary. While he bears no particular ill will against any person, his occupation involves killing many people, and the relatives of his victims may hold a grudge against him. Fultheim also thinks that somebody might have paid to have him killed because he recently performed a job in which he slaughtered sleeping people, despite his moral reservations. When intimidated, he will admit to sometimes getting carried away during battle.\r\nFultheim\u2019s title \u201cthe Fearless\u201d is an ironic one, as Fultheim is actually quite cowardly. He will constantly fight back tears and beg for his life when spoken to, insisting that he is just a soldier who follows orders.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen first approached:  \"What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry.\"\r\n\"I... I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you.\"\r\n\"Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!\"\r\n\"I'm just a soldier. Killing is my job! Surely you can't fault a man for doing his job?\"\r\n\"Please, oh gods, I don't want to die...\"\r\n\"Oh, gods, please! Let me live! I'll do anything you want!\"\r\n\"My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a... a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life. That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?\"\r\nIf asked if anyone would pay to have him killed: \"Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times... some times I got carried away? But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they? Could be someone wanted revenge. But... but you're not going to kill me. Right?\"\r\nIf the player unties Fultheim\u2019s bonds and frees him: \"Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!\"",
