    "bio": "Keerava lives in Riften. She is the innkeeper of the Bee and Barb, a popular tavern/inn near the Grand Plaza market square in the center of the city. She is welcoming to most customers.\r\nKeerava's lover Talen-Jei works at the tavern. Keerava and Talen-Jei are both Argonians. Keerava has shiny, scaly skin of gray and tan color, and bright red reptilian eyes. She typically wears standard women's barkeeper clothing, and most of her time is spent behind the bar counter.\r\nSome of the tavern's frequent patrons include Marcurio (Imperial man, mercenary/mage), Indaryn (Dunmer, runs the Black-Briar meadery), Romlyn Dreth (Dunmer, shady, works for the meadery), Mjoll the Lioness, Aerin (young man, Mjoll's friend), Maven Black-Briar, Sapphire (woman, member of the Thieves Guild), Vulwulf Snow-Shod (older wealthy man, fervent Stormcloak supporter), and various residents of the Bunkhouse, the nearby working-class lodging facility.\r\nMaramal (Redguard man, head priest at the Temple of Mara in Riften) occasionally comes in to preach Mara's teachings and harass/chastise the patrons for their \"sin\" of drunkenness, which prompts Keerava and Talen-Jei to ask Maramal to leave.\r\nThe Bee and Barb's name is a reference to an infamous excerpt from the book \"The Real Barenziah\", that describes one of Barenziah's risque escapades when was an adolescent in the slums of Riften, before she became the queen of Morrowind.\r\nKeerava was already running the Bee and Barb when Talen-Jei arrived in Riften a few years ago, and they quickly developed a connection. Now Keerava and him are trying to save enough money to leave Riften, as they are exasperated by the corruption and crime in the city. Maven, the matriarch of the Black-Briar family, de facto rules Riften via strongarmed business dealings and her connection to the Thieves Guild, making it hard for honest people in the city to make a living. Maven keeps rising the prices on the mead she sells to Keerava, but Keerava doesn't dare switch to selling a competitive meadery's product, out of fear of Maven's wrath.\r\nBrynjolf from the Thieves Guild claims that Keerava owes them more money, but Keerava refuses to pay them any longer. However, she will be forced to pay this extortion money if her family's farm in Morrowind is threatened.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.\"\r\n\"If you've got the coin, you're welcome here. Otherwise, hit the road.\"\r\n\"If you've got the coin, you've come to the right place. Pull up a seat.\"\r\n\"What can I get you? Mead? Wine?\"\r\n\"Looking for a place to stay?\"\r\n\"Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town.\"\r\n\"The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.\"\r\n\"Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.\"\r\n\"Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.\"\r\n\"If Maven Black-Briar keeps raising prices on mead, I'll have to resort to watering it down just to make ends meet.\"\r\n\"If it's true that the dragons have returned, what will it mean for all of us? Is this how it all ends?\"\r\n\"The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city.\"\r\n\"The only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste.\"\r\nIf asked where one can learn about magic: \"Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them. Else you could go see the jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.\"\r\nWhen a Thieves Guild member tries to get her to pay: \"I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!\"\r\nIf her family's farm in Morrowind is threatened: \"How could you possibly know about... Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them. Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.\"\r\nWhen speaking to a member of the Thieves Guild: \"Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want? Door's over there. Why don't you use it?\"\r\nIf asked where someone might be hiding in Riften: \"If you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be. There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other. You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive.\"",
