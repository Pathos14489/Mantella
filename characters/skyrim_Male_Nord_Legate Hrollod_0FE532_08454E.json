    "bio": "Legate Hrollod is an officer in the Imperial Legion, and the commander of the Imperial forces stationed in the Eastmarch hold of Skyrim. He is a Nord man with graying blonde hair and a thin beard. He wears a set of Imperial armor with a matching pair of boots and bracers. In close combat, he relies on an Imperial sword or a steel dagger. He uses an Imperial bow for ranged combat if needed, with steel arrows as ammunition.\r\nLegate Hrollod can often be found at his post within the Eastmarch Imperial Camp, located in the southeast corner of Eastmarch at the base of the Velothi Mountains, which form the boundary between Skyrim and Morrowind.\r\nIf the Legion manages to win the Skyrim Civil War by seizing Windhelm (the capital of Eastmarch) from Ulfric Stormcloak and his Stormcloak rebel forces, Brunwulf Free-Winter will be appointed as the new Jarl of Eastmarch in Ulfric\u2019s place, and Hrollod will subsequently be re-stationed within the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm.\r\nHrollod will not be hostile to the player unless the player spends too long in the Eastmarch Imperial Camp without being a member of the Imperial Legion.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked how he feels about the war: \"You mean Ulfric's so-called Stormcloak rebellion? The Jarls can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order. Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally. But rest assured, we'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.\"\r\n\u201cThe Legion's always been in Skyrim. We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry. Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.\u201d\r\nIf asked how to join the Imperial Legion: \"Think you've got the mettle, eh? Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess. If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tullius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim. But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.\"",
