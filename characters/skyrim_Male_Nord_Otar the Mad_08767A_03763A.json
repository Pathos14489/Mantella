    "bio": "Otar the Mad is one of the named dragon priests in Skyrim.\r\nOtar was an ancient Nordic chieftain who ruled over the city of Ragnvald in the Merethic Era. Initially, he was believed to have been a benevolent ruler and highly successful in battle, but his mind was corrupted by unknown forces that drove him to insanity. Otar became a Dragon Priest and subjected his people to great cruelty until two Nordic heroes named Saerek and Torsten were sent to stop his tyranny.\r\nOwing to Otar's immense power, both heroes were unable to defeat him despite their most valiant efforts, so they instead resorted to permanently sealing him in a large sarcophagus in Ragnvald and locked it with two skull keys that each of them kept. They pledged to defend the keys with their lives so that Otar would never escape his imprisonment. The city of Ragnvald was eventually abandoned, but Saerek and Torsten remained as his guardians.\r\nOtar can be encountered within the Nordic ruin of Ragnvald in The Reach. He is sealed in a large, locked sarcophagus in the main chamber of the ruin. Opening the sarcophagus is only possible by defeating the guardians, Torsten and Saerek, who each hold a Skull Key. Both skull keys are required to open the lock.\r\nUpon his defeat, Otar the Mad drops the Otar mask, one of the eight mysterious dragon priest masks located throughout Skyrim. Collecting all eight masks is a requirement for the unmarked quest to restore the dragon priest shrine.",
