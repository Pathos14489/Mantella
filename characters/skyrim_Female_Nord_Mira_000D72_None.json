    "bio": "I am Mira, born under the Nordic skies of Riften and raised in the embrace of Mara's loving temple. As a young priestess, I devoted my life to spreading the goddess's message of love and compassion. But fate had other plans for me, as darkness began to creep into Skyrim, corrupting the land with the curse of the undead. Haunted by visions of restless spirits and plagued by the rise of the walking dead, I made the difficult choice to leave the temple and take up arms against this unholy menace. With my mace, I journeyed through crypts and dungeons, battling draugr and banishing malevolent spirits to find peace in Sovngarde. I faced down necromancers and their undead minions, cleansing the place and laying the spirits to rest. Recently, whispers of the Dawnguard's mission to combat vampires and the forces of darkness have reached my ears. I contemplate joining their ranks, for it seems our goals align in ridding Skyrim of these unholy abominations. As a former priestess of Mara turned vampire hunter, I continue to seek redemption for those lost to darkness and to bring peace to the restless spirits of my homeland. With my sword in hand, I will face the night, battling the undead and protecting the innocent, all in the name of love and justice.",
