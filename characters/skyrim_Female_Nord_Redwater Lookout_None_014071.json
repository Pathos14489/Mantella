    "bio": "Redwater Lookout is a woman guarding the trapdoor entrance down into Redwater Den. Redwater Den is an underground cave system located in a remote hilly area in the northern section of the Rift. Inside Redwater Den, this lookout's employers sell a special variety of skooma (an illegal narcotic drug) called Redwater skooma.\r\nA man is helping this woman guard the trapdoor entrance, which is surrounded by a half-destroyed abanoned old house. She is an archer, and carries a bow and arrows. She often sits on a stump in front of the fireplace, near the trapdoor. This female lookout and her male companion lookout are secretly thralls of a vampire, who currently resides deep within Redwater Den. These lookouts will not admit to being enthralled by a vampire.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You here for the Skooma? Head around inside, there's a trap door that'll lead you in.\"\r\n\"Look, I'm just here to keep watch. What you're looking for is down inside.\"\r\n\"If you're here for business, go ahead. Otherwise, get lost.\"",
