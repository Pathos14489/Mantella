    "bio": "Lillith Maiden-Loom is an elderly Nord and an acquaintance of Maven Black-Briar.\r\nLillith Maiden-Loom is a citizen of Whiterun. She lives just outside the city walls in the Whiterun Stables with her employees Skulvar Sable-Hilt and, his son, Jervar. Not much is known about Lillith's past, but there are indications that she has lived a shady character's life in her younger years. She also claims to be a friend of Maven Black-Briar, from the Black-Briar Family in Riften, which might lead the conclusion that she has done some work with Maven in the past.\r\nKilling Lillith Maiden-Loom will result in the Dragonborn receiving a Letter from Jervar.",
