    "bio": "Bella lives in Morthal, where she works as a servant at Highmoon Hall. Highmoon Hall is the name of the jarl's longhouse. From this longhouse, Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone (an elderly woman) governs over Morthal and the rest of Hjaalmarch (of which Morthal is the capital).\r\nIdgrod has an older teenage daughter named Idgrod the Younger, and a young son named Joric. She raises her two children with Aslfur, her husband and court steward. A man named Gorm is her personal housecarl.\r\nIf the Stormcloak rebellion seizes control of Morthal, Idgrod and her family will be forced into exile at the Blue Palace in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim.\r\nBella is a young Imperial woman with relatively dark skin. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit. She spends most of her working hours serving food and drinks to the inhabitants of the longhouse, as well as to important visitors.",
