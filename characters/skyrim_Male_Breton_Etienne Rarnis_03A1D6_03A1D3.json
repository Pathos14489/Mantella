    "bio": "Etienne Rarnis is a Breton thief and a member of the Thieves Guild found imprisoned inside the Thalmor Embassy.\r\nHe was captured and interrogated due to a possible affiliation with the wanted Blades loremaster Esbern, who was being protected by the Thieves Guild in The Ratway Warrens below Riften. If the Dragonborn is a member of the Thieves Guild, Etienne remembers them from The Ragged Flagon.\r\nShould the Dragonborn choose to free Etienne from his cell at the Thalmor Embassy, he flees to a trapdoor leading to Reeking Cave, commenting \"You didn't have to help me, so.... thanks.\" In the cave, he may assist in a battle against a frost troll, although unarmed unless he picks up a weapon.\r\nIf he survives, he will initially run past Solitude and be found on the coastline immediately south of the Dainty Sload. Later on, he can be found in the Ragged Flagon Cistern, and gladly sees that the Dragonborn has survived, promising that he will never forget who saved him from his Thalmor captors. After his release he might also be found at the bridge near Windhelm Stables wearing Thieves Guild Armor.\r\nToward the end of the quest, Etienne can be found in a prison cell, being interrogated by Rulindil and some Thalmor guards. The Dragonborn can either free him or leave him in his cell.",
