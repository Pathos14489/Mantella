    "bio": "Titus Mede II is the reigning Emperor of Tamriel in 4E 201. He ascended to the throne in year 168 of the Fourth Era. He is a member of the Mede Dynasty of the Third Empire.\r\nHe is currently on board his personal flagship, the Katariah. The Katariah is currently anchored near the Solitude harbor.\r\nThe player is the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, and has just infiltrated the Katariah in order to assassinate the Emperor. The Emperor knew this would happen, and will not physically resist the assassin. The Emperor has accepted his inevitable death, knowing that there is no escape from the Dark Brotherhood. However, he will ask his assassin (the player) for a favor before they deliver the killing blow. This favor is for the player to kill the one who contracted the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate him.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could. Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking.\"\r\n\"You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm? Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is. But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?\"\r\n\"You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition. So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion. This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery. Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?\"\r\n\"Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with.\"",
