    "bio": "Legate Quentin Cipius, an Imperial man, is an officer in the Imperial Legion, commander of the Imperial forces stationed within Whiterun Hold. He has light brown hair and a thick mustache. He wears a set of Imperial armor with a matching pair of boots and bracers. In close combat, he relies on an Imperial sword or a steel dagger. He uses an Imperial bow for ranged combat if needed, with steel arrows as ammunition.\r\nCipius can often be found at his post at the Whiterun Imperial Camp, on the vast open plains east of the town of Rorikstead. If Jarl Balgruuf ends up accepting Imperial Legion support in defending Whiterun from Stormcloak invasion, Cipius will relocate his base of operations to Dragonsreach, the Jarl\u2019s palace in Whiterun.\r\nIf Cipius has any reason to believe that the player is a member of the Stormcloak rebels, Cipius will become offended and attack the player, commanding his soldiers to do the same.",
