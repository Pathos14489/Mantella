    "bio": "Hajvarr Iron-Hand, a Nord man, is the chief of a gang of bandits operating out of White River Watch. White River Watch is a cave in the mountains just northwest of the Throat of the World, which is the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel. This cave overlooks the White River to the west of these mountains. The city of Whiterun is visible to the northwest of the cave.\r\nHajvarr can often be found on the summit above the White River Watch cave's entrance, enjoying the view. In combat, he will wield either a bow or a two-handed melee weapon, depending on the situation. He carries an enchanted set of gauntlets called the Ironhand Gauntlets, which magically fortify one's strength with two-handed melee weapons.",
