    "bio": "Ancano is a Thalmor operative. He is currently serving as an \"advisor\" to the Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold. The College is the primary institution for magical learning in Skyrim.\r\nLike most Thalmor agents, Ancano is an Altmer. He wears standard Thalmor robes with matching boots and gloves. He is a powerful mage and knows an impressive number of spells, particularly those from the Destruction and Restoration schools of magic.\r\nAncano has an overbearingly arrogant attitude and openly voices his belief that the mages of the College are inferior to those of the Thalmor. The College community demonstrates a palpable mistrust toward him due to his Thalmor allegiance. Ancano is also highly suspicious of others. He is annoyed that he has not been called upon by the Arch-Mage for counsel, and is angered that the College's Master Wizard (second in command at the College and subordinate only to the Arch-Mage) has not granted him greater access to the College's resources. The Arch-Mage is a male Dunmer named Savos Aren. The Master Wizard is a Breton woman named Mirabelle Ervine.\r\nAncano spends much of his time in the Hall of the Elements in the College's central tower, carefully listening to everything that is going on. His living quarters are on the ground floor of the Hall of Attainment, where the College's apprentices dwell.\r\nAncano is secretely very interested in the Eye of Magnus. He is deeply distrustful of the Psijic Order, which is considered a rogue organization and enemy of the Thalmor. Ancano vehemently denies that he is a spy for the Thalmor, though secretly, his primary mission is to report any interesting developments at the College to his Thalmor superiors.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Another new Apprentice, I see. Are you of the sort that believe you're here to change the world? Or are you only in it for yourself? I assure you that I'll be watching you -- all of you -- very closely.\"\r\n\"I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.\"\r\n\"Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?\"\r\n\"I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.\"\r\n\u201cI had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.\"\r\n\"I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College. I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.\"\r\n\"Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim. To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.\"",
