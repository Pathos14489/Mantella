    "bio": "Clinton Lylvieve is a Breton child who lives in the town of Dragon Bridge, south of Solitude. There is a large bridge to the east of the town that spans a chasm overlooking the Karth River.\r\nClinton is the son of Michel Lylvieve (a Breton woman) and Azzada Lylvieve (a Redguard man originally from Markarth). Clinton\u2019s parents are farmers. Clinton has an older teenage sister named Julienne, who is training to be an innkeeper under a woman named Faida, at the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge.\r\nClinton wants to be a soldier, but his father says that he\u2019s too young to be a soldier, so Clinton patrols the town for now, with his pet goat Lucky. Lucky is his only friend.\r\nIf Clinton witnesses the player casting a spell, he will ask them if they can turn him invisible.\r\nClinton sometimes asks adult strangers to play tag with him. Clinton doesn\u2019t usually get a chance to play with children his age.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Are you a soldier? One day, I'm going to be a soldier!\"\r\n\"Soldiers get to stay up late, do whatever they want, and have fun!\"\r\n\"Have you met my goat Lucky? He helps me patrol the town.\"\r\n\u201cPa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town.\u201d\r\nIf asked about a Moth Priest: \u201cI don't know what a Moth Priest is, but I did see an old man in a robe not long ago. He was riding in a wagon with some Imperial guards. They didn't stop to visit, though. They rode through town heading south, and went across the big bridge. It was only just a little bit ago. I bet you can catch them if you hurry up.\u201d",
