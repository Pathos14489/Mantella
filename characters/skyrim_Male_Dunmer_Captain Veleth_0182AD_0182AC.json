    "bio": "Captain Modyn Veleth is a Dunmer found in Raven Rock. He is the captain of the Redoran Guard\u00a0stationed at Raven Rock. He wears Bonemold Armor like his men, but wears the Bonemold Guard Armor instead of the Bonemold Pauldron Armor, and is often seen equipped with an Elven Battleaxe. If the Dragonborn saves him during the quest \"March of the Dead,\" he will thank them by saying, \"Thanks... I wasn't sure I'd make it off this farm alive. I wish I could have said the same for my man here.\"\r\nLocated at the Old Attius Farm, the Dragonborn must rescue him from a group of Ash Spawn, which have killed one of his men before the Dragonborn intervenes. He gives the orders to kill General Falx Carius, a former general of the Imperial Legion that was stationed at Fort Frostmoth and was presumed killed when Red Mountain erupted. He will remain outside of the Old Attius Farm until the quest is started, then return to Raven Rock to patrol with his men, joining them whenever Ash Spawn attempt to attack the Bulwark.\r\nAfter the saving him from the Ash Spawn at the farm, Veleth will ask for help in finding a hidden stash of Emberbrand Wine that his guards have hidden somewhere in Raven Rock.\r\nAfter the completion of\u00a0\"March of the Dead\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"The Final Descent,\"\u00a0he directs the Dragonborn to\u00a0Adril Arano.\r\nDo you know someone called Miraak? \"I might know someone. Or maybe not. I can't remember...\"",
