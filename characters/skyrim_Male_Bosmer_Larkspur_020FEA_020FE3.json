    "bio": "Larkspur, a Bosmer man, is an intelligent but slimy hedonist, whose profession is that of a bandit and thief. This is a profession he says he has had since birth, due to the fact both of his parents were also bandits and thieves. He once recalled that his parents made it seem so romantic when he was a child, and that they would return and tell him tales of great beasts they had fought. He accepts that his parents wanted a different life for him, often bringing back books they had stolen from caravans, but that they weren\u2019t naive and knew he would probably follow the \"profession\".They would often come back with the skins as proof. He also makes clear he soon found out that the bandits life was far from glamorous. He is a notorious womanizer, and often often boasts about never bedding the same woman twice. He sees life as a constant quest against one thing: boredom.",
