As she is an orphan, she can be adopted.\r\nLucia is one of the orphans in Skyrim who can be adopted by the Dragonborn. To initiate this, she must be given a septim and asked why she is begging. She will explain that her mother died, and her aunt and uncle kicked her out when they took over her mother's farm.\u00a0She then arrived in Whiterun, and took to the streets, where\u00a0Brenuin\u00a0showed care for her, and told her to ask the townsfolk\u00a0for\u00a0septims.\u00a0She can be adopted if the conditions for adoption (owning a home with a furnished child's bedroom) are met.",
