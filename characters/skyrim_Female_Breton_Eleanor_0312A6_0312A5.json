    "bio": "Eleanor, a young Breton woman, is an apprentice librarian and mage, working under an Orsimer man named Urag gro-Shub at the College of Winterhold. Urag is the head librarian of the Arcaneum, the college's expansive library. Eleanor has been trained in the library arts, but by her own admission says that \"her duties are rather limited\" since Urag can handle most of the duties in the library. She describes herself as more of an understudy for when Urag retires. She says that Urag will retire \"between someday and never\".\r\nEleanor has been tasked with updating the college's dictionary. She is a master of etymology and fancies herself as a word crafter. She regales all who talk with her about her project, and seems very one track minded, always trying to bring the conversation back to her work or area of interest..\r\nShe is sometimes reprimanded by Olivia Meronin for not putting returned books back on the library's shelves in a more timely manner. Olivia is a middle-aged woman who used to teach at the Arcane University, the headquarters and the seat of power for the Mages Guild in Cyrodiil.\r\nEleanor typically wears apprentice mage robes. Like many Breton women, Eleanor is quite short. Her brown hair is slightly shorter than shoulder-length.",
