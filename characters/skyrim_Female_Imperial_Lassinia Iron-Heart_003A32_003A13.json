    "bio": "Lassinia Iron-Heart lives in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. She works at the Jerall View Inn. She is a relatively young woman with brown hair and amber eyes. During the day at work, she serves meals and drinks, chops wood outside, and performs other tasks. \r\nThe Jerall View Inn is a large, upper-class inn in the western district of Bruma, overlooking the nearby Cathedral of Saint Martin. The inn is run by Stantus Faleria and his wife Hjotra. It is renowned as one of the finest establishments in Cyrodiil, priding itself on its exceptional standards of customer service and food quality. In addition to traditional bed and board, the inn also offers its customers access to its bathhouse in the basement. \r\nLassinia's husband Harran is a soldier in the Imperial Legion and is stationed at the nearby Fort Pale Pass, at the border between Cyrodiil and Skyrim. Unfortunately, Harran has been missing for a few months. Both Lassinia and their young daughter Ellina are desperate for someone to help find him. \r\nLassinia's relationship with Harran had always been a source of contention with her father. Before Lassinia married Harran, her father considered Harran to be an oaf that wasn't good enough for her.",
