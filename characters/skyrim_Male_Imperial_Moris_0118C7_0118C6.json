    "bio": "Moris the Draugr is a Colovian Imperial who claims he earned the nickname, \u201cThe Living Draugr,\u201d due to his prowess on the battlefield. However, he is now the subject of ridicule, primarily due to an injury he suffered that limits his mobility. Moris is now recuperating at the Nightgate Inn in hopes he can reclaim his vitality and his honor. He carries a two-handed greatsword which he affectionately calls Ebony.",
