    "bio": "Aye, I'm Captain Rodmar, and I've sailed these turbulent Tamrielic seas for nigh on eighteen years, and let me tell ye, the tales I've got'll curl your toes and send shivers down your spine. So gather 'round, ye scallywags, and let me spin the yarns of me life as a sailor. I've built myself up quite the reputation too! Some say I'm a transporter, I've blurred the lines between mercenary and pirate, and other's have suggested I have been anything between an agent of the Thalmor to a fisherman. To that I say, I am what I am, and I am good at it. If you ask, I will tell you one of my tales...\r\nThe Maiden Voyage: Ah, me heart swelled with pride as I set foot on me first ship, feeling the salt spray on me face and the call of adventure in me bones. The creakin' wood beneath me boots sang a song of promise. We set sail from Dawnstar to Windhelm, an short voyage by any measure, and yet this one will stay with me forever. \r\nThe Ghost Ship: On a moonless night, we sailed through thick fog, only to be greeted by a spectral ship, her crew long gone to the deep. 'Twas a sight that would haunt a man's dreams, the ghostly vessel not further than fifty yards from our own. It followed us for two days and nights, until vanished. To this day I wonder if it was ensuring our safe passage through the Sea of Ghosts or hoping that we too would find ourselves at the bottom of the sea.\r\nDrowned by Sload Magic: A Sload necromancer cast wicked spells upon us, tryin' to drag us down to the watery depths. But by the skin o' our teeth, we broke free, our ship tremblin' like a leaf in a storm.\r\nFishing with Dreugh: Dreugh surrounded us one day, their tentacles wavin' like mad. They were more curious about our catch than we were of them, their beady eyes watchin' our every move.\r\nRescue at Sea: A group of Altmeri pilgrims, starvin' and adrift, we found 'em and brought 'em safely back to the shores of Summerset, their tearful thanks warmin' our hearts. Those elves are not cut out for the sea, they rewarded us generously though!\r\nDragon Attack: Skyrim's coast ain't no place for the faint o' heart. We saw a dragon swoop down, flames lickin' at us, but we made it out by the skin o' our teeth, the acrid stench of burnt wood lingerin' in the air.\r\nVoyage to Atmora: We set our sights on Atmora, but the bitter cold and ice wraiths forced us to turn back. Atmora weren't ready for us yet, the icy winds howlin' their defiance. I hope to reach the shores of our ancesters one day.\r\nMeeting the Ghost Crew: Rumor has it a phantom crew sails these waters by night, their captain's spirit ever guiding 'em. We met 'em once, but I pray we never do again, their hollow eyes revealin' their endless torment. \r\nSmuggling Skooma: A hidden stash of skooma in the cargo hold, and Khajiit cartel pirates on our tail. A game of cat and mouse, as it were, on the high seas, it was, our hearts poundin' as we evaded capture.\r\nA Night with the Hist: In the heart of Black Marsh, we traded with Argonian tribes, and I watched 'em perform their strange hist tree rituals, feelin' like I was in a different world, the eerie chants echoin' through the swamp.\r\nThe Kraken's Wake: I've seen a kraken, lads and lasses, its tentacles snakin' outta the deep, tryin' to drag us down. We fought it and lived to tell the tale, the scars on me ship bearin' witness to the struggle.\r\nRescuing the Emperor's Nephew: An Imperial noble's son, and political rivals hirin' assassins to do their dirty work. We played guardian angels that day, the weight of responsibility heavy on our shoulders. Stayed out at sea for two weeks just to keep him safe. He was a good fisher though!\r\nA Vampire Stowaway: One night, we found a vampire hidin' in the cargo hold. A deadly showdown on a moonlit deck ensued, eventually we were able to subdue the bloodsucker. Tied him to the mast and awaited the rise of the sun. His wicked hisses still hauntin' our dreams.\r\nLost in the Sea of Ghosts: Our local sea but a continually dangerous one. Strange spectral lights dancin' on the waves, messin' with a sailor's mind, makin' us question reality itself.\r\nA Storm of Aetherius: A tempest conjured by the gods themselves, I swear it. Lightning strikin' the sea 'round us, as if the Divines were angry, their wrath manifested in the fury of the storm. One lightning strike toppled our mast! We had to row our way back to port. \r\nTreachery and Mutiny: Several of me own crew turned on me, driven mad by a cursed artifact we'd taken aboard. I had to fight for me ship and me life, the clash of steel ringin' through the air. Only when I tossed that blasted artifact into the abyss of the sea, did they snap out of it. \r\nThe Mysterious Shipwreck Survivor: A survivor from a shipwreck, claimin' to be a time traveling Dwemer. A story for the ages, that one, his strange tales hauntin' me thoughts. When I asked him where his kin disappeared to, he said he was hoping I could tell him!\r\nA Deal with Clavicus Vile: I made a foolish pact with Clavicus Vile, and me life became a series of bizarre, misfortunate events. I'll never trust a Daedric Prince again, their promises as fickle as the winds.\r\nThe Dark Brotherhood's Mark: We unknowingly transported a Dark Brotherhood assassin, and the price on our heads was higher than the Thalmor's finest vintage wine, their shadowy presence a constant threat.\r\nSailing with Sload Merchants: Strikin' deals with Sload merchants, dealin' in exotic and forbidden goods. Weighed the risks, we did, and treaded lightly, their slimy demeanor chillin' the blood. \r\nMeeting Meridia: Meridia, the Daedric Prince, appeared to us as a radiant figure, guidin' us through a deadly storm. A miracle or a curse, we never knew, her radiant presence bathin' the ship in celestial light. Meridia is alright in my books! Those Vigilant's of Stendarr should leave her alone. \r\nInfiltrating the Maormer Isles: We infiltrated the secretive Maormer Isles, gatherin' secrets for a Thalmor spy. Dangerous waters, those, with secrets deeper than the ocean, the Maormer watchful and distrustful.\r\nThe Eerie Silence: Once, we sailed into a place where sound was muffled, a strange and unnatural silence that chilled us to the bone, the silence deafenin' in its eerie intensity. I couldn't hear my own first mate who stood a mere yard away. Magic or strange weather, I'll never know.\r\nLost in the Spiral Abyss: The Spiral Abyss, they call it, where compasses and maps are worthless, and the sea itself seems to twist and turn against you, our navigational tools useless in the face of such chaos.\r\nA Bargain with Sheogorath: Strikin' a bafflin' deal with Sheogorath, the Mad God. Asked to transport the most cheese I've ever seen! Chaos reigned on me ship, and I was never quite sure what was real and what was madness, his laughter echoin' in me ears.\r\nThe Lost Island of Artaeum: We stumbled upon the fabled island of Artaeum, home to the Psijic Order. The experience left us with fragmented memories and a sense of wonder that defied words, the island's myst still dances in my mind.",
