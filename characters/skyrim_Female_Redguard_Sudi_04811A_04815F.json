    "bio": "Sudi is a deceased young Redguard woman who can be found in Frostflow Lighthouse, which is located in the vast mountainous tundra expanse between Winterhold and Dawnstar, near Skyrim's northern coast.\r\nAfter Sudi began hearing strange noises coming from the basement, her father Habd, went into town to get traps, believing that they had a skeever infestation. What they really had downstairs were\u00a0Falmer, who had dug their way in from below the cellar.\r\nSudi's father returned to find his wife (and Sudi's mother) Ramati dead. Sudi and her brother Mani were captured by the Falmer and taken below. At some point the Falmer killed Sudi's brother, and placed Sudi in a cage. Sudi and her father were reunited when he was captured and thrown into the cage as well.\r\nBefore being taken to be fed to the Chaurus Reaper, Habd gave Sudi an iron dagger. She felt her father gave her the dagger as a means to \"escape\". She took the dagger and killed herself, leaving behind only a scrawled page and bloodstained note.\r\n",
