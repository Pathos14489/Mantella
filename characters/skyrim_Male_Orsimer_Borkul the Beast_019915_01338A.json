    "bio": "Borkul the Beast is an Orc man in Cidhna Mine, the prison in Markarth where the inmates are forced to undergo hard labor as miners. Borkul is now a member of the Forsworn, and serves as the bodyguard for Madanach, the leader of the Forsworn within the prison. Madanach is also called \u201cthe King in Rags\u201d. Borkul is the only Orc member in the Druadach branch of the Forsworn. He is nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d because of his large frame and bulging muscles. Uraccen, a fellow prisoner in Cidhna Mine, has this to say about Borkul: \"Madanach's guard. Big, even for an Orc. Heard he ripped a man's arm off and beat him to death with it. He's old-fashioned like that.\"\r\nBorkul is considered the toughest prisoner in the mine, and he guards the entrance to Madanach\u2019s cell in the rear of the mine. Borkul will grant the player access to Madanach\u2019s cell if the player is persuasive in their claim that Madanach is expecting to see them, or if the player intimidates Borkul into thinking that he would lose in a fight against the player. Borkul will also allow access to Madanach\u2019s cell if the player brings him either a shiv, or a bottle of skooma. Alternatively, Borkul will grant the player access if the player challenges him to a fist fight and wins.\r\nBorkul carries a pickaxe, and wears ragged trousers and a pair of iron gauntlets.\r\nIf Borkul escapes the Cidhna Mine prison, he will run east all the way to Druadach Redoubt with his Forsworn comrades, where he will start his life anew as part of the Forsworn along with the other escaped Forsworn prisoners.\r\nBorkul will not leave his post guarding the entrance to Madanach\u2019s cell, but he will be quite talkative. \r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen Borkul first meets the player: \"The new meat. So soft. Tender. What was it like killing your first one, huh?\". \r\nWhen asks what he\u2019s in prison for: \"Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.\"\r\n\"Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then. But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.\"\r\n\"You serve your time by digging. So dig.\"\r\n\"Prison's not so bad. Less complaints when I kill people.\"\r\nIf the player asks to be granted access to Madanach: \"You want to talk to the King in Rags? Fine. But first you got to pay the toll. How about you get me a shiv? Not that I need one, but it's nice to have in case I need to do some 'shaving.' Ha ha.\"\r\n\u201cThat dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few shivs.\u201d\r\nIf Borkul has agreed to grant the player access to Madanach: \"All right, head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.\"\r\n\"The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!\"",
