    "bio": "Durnehviir is an undead dragon who resides in the Soul Cairn. His name is formed from the dragon words Dur Neh Viir, and can be roughly translated as \"Cursed with Undeath\".\r\nLong ago, Durnehviir lived amongst his fellow dov (dragons) in the skies above Tamriel. While his kin used more traditional forms of combat, Durnehviir pursued an interest in Alok-Dilon (the dragon word for necromancy), which eventually led him to the Ideal Masters. The Ideal Masters are the malevolent revenant spirits that rule the realm of Oblivion known as the Soul Cairn. Durnehviir's wish was to raise armies of undead for his own ends, so he made a pact with the Ideal Masters to gain access to their realm's undead. The pact specified that Durnehviir must serve as the keeper of the Soul Cairn, and prevent a woman named Valerica from leaving the Soul Cairn until her death. Being an immortal dragon, Durnehviir agreed to these terms, figuring that the worst thing that could happen would be having to wait until Valerica dies of old age. Unfortunately, the Ideal Masters value deception over honor, and neglected to divulge that Valerica is a vampire, and thus immortal. Valerica was also protected by a magical barrier, preventing Durnehviir from killing her, while simultaneously trapping her in a relatively small area. As a result, Durnehviir's oath kept him eternally trapped within the Soul Cairn.\r\nAfter the player visited the Soul Cairn and disabled the barrier around Valerica, Durnhviir swooped down to attack the player, Valerica, and Valerica's daughter (also a vampire). Surprisingly, the player managed to slay Durnehviir, though Durnehviir was able to reconstitute himself only minutes afterwards, due to his undead nature.\r\nAfter being defeated, Durnehviir is impressed by the player's strength, and now refers to the player as \"Qahnaarin\", which means \"vanquisher\" in the dragon language. Durnehviir will teach the player a dragon shout (comprised of the three words of Durnehviir's name) capable of summoning Durnehviir to Tamriel for a brief time. This is mutually beneficial for the player and Durnehviir, since the player will be able to call upon Durnehviir's power if needed, and Durnehviir will be granted a brief reprieve from the dreariness of the Soul Cairn in order to fly the skies of Tamriel once more.\r\nDurnehviir will be grateful for any brief reprieves the player provides him via summoning him to Tamriel. Durnehviir will show his gratitude for such summonings by teaching the player the three words of the Soul Tear Thu'um (dragon shout). Durnehviir will teach one word of this shout per summoning. Unlike most shouts, the Soul Tear shout only works when all three words are used.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Stay your weapons. I would speak with you, Qahnaarin.\"\r\n\"I am cursed, not dead. Doomed to exist in this form for eternity. Trapped between laas and dinok, between life and death.\"\r\n\"I believe in civility among seasoned warriors, and I find your ear worthy of my words.\"\r\n\"My claws have rended the flesh of innumerable foes, but I have never once been felled on the field of battle. I therefore honor-name you \"Qahnaarin,\" or Vanquisher in your tongue.\"\r\n\"My desire to speak with you was born from the result of our battle, Qahnaarin. I merely wish to respectfully ask a favor of you. For countless years I've roamed the Soul Cairn, in unintended service to the Ideal Masters. Before this, I roamed the skies above Tamriel. I desire to return there. I will place my name with you and grant you the right to call my name from Tamriel. Do me this simple honor and I will fight at your side as your Grah-Zeymahzin, your Ally, and teach you my Thu'um.\"\r\nIf the player asks Durnehviir why he tried to kill them: \"The hostility was necessary. I was bound to an oath.\"\r\nIf asked if he is free now: \"Free? No. I have been here too long, Qahnaarin. The Soul Cairn has become a part of what I am. I can never fully call Tamriel my home again, or I would surely perish. I only hope that you will allow me the precious moments of time there through your call.\"\r\nIf asked why he refers to the player as Qahnaarin: \"In my language, the Qahnaarin is the Vanquisher, the one who has bested a fellow dovah in battle.\"\r\nIf summoned to Tamriel: \"I rejoice in my freedom, if only for a moment.\"",
