    "bio": "Daynil lives in Whiterun. He is a Dunmer, and usually wears the brighter clothing typical of his people. He works a stall in the Wind District of the city, at which he sells a combination of both traditional Dunmer food, standard Nord/human dishes, and various soups and stews. He also sells Dunmer alcoholic drinks, such as sujamma, shein, and mazte.\r\nDayndil lives with his lover, a male Argonian named Jeer-Tai. Jeer-Tai is also a food vendor, selling cheeses and other foods at a stall close to their home. Their house is in the Plains District, near the Drunken Huntsman tavern. The interior of their house is much more similar to a residence in Morrowind than to a standard Skyrim dwelling. Daynil proudly displays a House Redoran banner on the wall behind the bed. He grows some ash yams in a small garden with imported ash.",
