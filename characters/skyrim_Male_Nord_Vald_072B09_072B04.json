    "bio": "Vald is a Nord who is an associate of the Thieves Guild in Riften.\r\nHe previously worked for Maven Black-Briar, but, during a job transporting the Quill of Gemination across Lake Honrich, he crashed the boat and lost the quill. Since then, he has been in debt to Maven and worked as a guard watching over Riftweald Manor, owned by Mercer Frey.\r\nDuring the Thieves Guild quest \"The Pursuit,\" it was revealed that Vald also had close and romantic ties with Vex.\r\nVald will always have the iron dagger, Mercer's House Key and a leveled bandits' loot.\r\nDuring the quest the Dragonborn must infiltrate Mercer Frey's house; however, Vald is keeping guard of it and must be either killed, pickpocketed or persuaded to part with the key. Vex reveals that Vald only cares about money and that erasing his debts with Maven Black-Briar would gain his good side.\r\nUpon retrieving the Quill of Gemination and returning it to Maven, she will erase Vald's debt. Informing Vald that his debt is erased will result in him happily allowing the Dragonborn into Mercer's house before leaving Riften.",
