    "bio": "Madesi is an Argonian jeweler found in Riften's town square. He remains one of the few traditional Saxhleel jewelers in Tamriel. \r\n\r\nMadesi lives in Beggar's Row, under the Riften canals. For most of the day, he waits around his stand for customers, before having a final meal at Haelga's Bunkhouse, and returning to the canals once more, to sleep with two other beggars.\r\n\r\nBeing a Saxhleel jeweler, bandits and other disturbances have made journeys to mines and other towns difficult, thus his profession becomes more difficult each day.\r\n\r\nMadesi asks the Dragonborn for a small list of items: one gold ore, a mammoth tusk, and two flawless sapphires, so he may continue creating jewelry.\r\n\r\nBrynjolf wants to initiate the Dragonborn into the Thieves Guild, by framing Brand-Shei for theft. The Dragonborn must steal Madesi's silver ring and pickpocket it into Brand-Shei's pocket.\r\n\r\nDo you make your own jewelry? \"I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art. Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse. Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.\"",
