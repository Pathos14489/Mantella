    "bio": "Melea Entius is an Imperial woman afflicted with an unknown illness. Fearing her daughter would grow up an orphan, she traveled to Skyrim in search of a cure. A staunchly religious person, she believes the Divines guided her to Falkreath to help her come to terms with her eventual death. Upon her inveitable death, Melea has arranged for her young daughter Henrietta to be adopted an Imperial couple in Falkreath. Mathies and his wife Indara Caerellia are farmers, and recently tragically lost their own daughter to a werewolf attack. This makes them the perfect couple to adopt Henrietta once Melea dies.",
