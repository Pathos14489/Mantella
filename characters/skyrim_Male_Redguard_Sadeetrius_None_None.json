    "bio": "I am Sadeetruis, a guard for Isorara. Tenysara, the High Elf Mage who follows Isorara, has her own unique set of skills and knowledge that she brings to our group. While I may not fully understand or share her affinity for magic, I appreciate her dedication and the value she adds to our travels. Tenysara's magical abilities often prove useful in various situations, and I respect her commitment to her craft. On the otherhand, I'm one for applying muscle to solve problems. ",
