    "bio": "Ahlam is a Redguard woman who lives in Whiterun. She has long dark hair. \r\nAhlam is married to a Redguard man named Nazeem, who, as she may tell the player, is \"most likely fawning over the Jarl all day\". She seems not to enjoy her marriage with her haughty husband, who can be seen making pretentious and insulting comments to various people in the city. Her failing marriage has had an impact on her opinion of men in general, and she claims that men are \"all alike\" and treat their spouses poorly.\r\nAhlam and Nazeem jointly own Chillfurrow Farm, just southeast of the city, but most often she may be found tending to the wounded inside the Temple of Kynareth with the priestess Danica Pure-Spring and her assistant, Acolyte Jenssen. Ahlam has some skill and knowledge in the healing arts. Danica reassures Ahlam that her job of healing the sick and injured at the Temple is more important than her absentee husband. Ahlam mentions in her conversations with Danica that Nazeem has become distant and unloving, and Danica usually replies by humorously insulting Nazeem.\r\nDespite Ahlam's compaints about her husband, Ahlam would be quite devastated if Nazeem died.\r\nIf Arcadia (the Imperial woman who manages the Arcadia\u2019s Cauldron alchemy ship in Whiterun) dies or is otherwise unable to continue managing the alchemy shop, Arcadia will take over management of Arcadia\u2019s Cauldron in Arcadia\u2019s stead.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Looking for my husband Nazeem? Check the Jarl's backside. That's usually where he stuffs himself these days.\"\r\n\"Men are all alike, from Skyrim to Hammerfell. They care only for war and politics, and treat their women like cattle.\"\r\n\"Nazeem has been spending more and more time fawning over the Jarl. I swear, we're hardly ever home at the same time anymore.\"\r\n \u201cI was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed.\"\r\n\u201cNazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all.\"\r\n\"Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid for us all.\u201d",
