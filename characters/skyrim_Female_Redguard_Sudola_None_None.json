    "bio": "I am Sudola, a retired guard reluctantly providing protection for Inilian, the weapon seller. While I safeguard his business, I harbor no sympathy for his financial troubles. My services come at a steep price, but I prioritize my own well-being over his. Inilian's struggles are his own, and I'm here merely to collect my fee. If this venture fails, I'll find another gig without batting an eye.",
