    "bio": "He is a farmer who lives in Kynesgrove, a small town south of Windhelm. The Velothi Mountains to the east loom over the town. The nearby Steamscorch Mine, from which malachite ore is mined, is Kynesgrove's main point of interest.\r\nThis farmer is worried about the group of bandits (though they claim to be \"knights\") who have recently come into town demanding protection money. Unfortunately, the few guardsmen of the town can't be expected to stand against a couple dozen bandits, and the Jarl's men are stretched thin enough as it is.",
