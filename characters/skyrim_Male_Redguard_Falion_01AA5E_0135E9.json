    "bio": "Falion is a Redguard mage in Skyrim who resides in Morthal. Before settling in the town, Falion was the Conjuration master at the College of Winterhold, a position now held by his former pupil Phinis Gestor. He left because he hated to have to report to Savos Aren, the Arch-Mage of the College, as well as disliking \"where the College is headed,\" as Phinis says. He is also the brother of Morthal's innkeeper, Jonna.\r\nDue to Conjuration's association with Necromancy, the people of the town accuse him of all sorts of wrongdoings, such as killing children and eating the hearts of the dead. Falion takes care of an adopted orphan, Agni, and is also teaching her the ways of magic. He can be found wandering around Morthal or at his house.\r\nFalion is a Master level Conjuration trainer and also sells spell tomes from all magic schools and Black Soul Gems.\r\nUpon first encountering Falion, he seems annoyed, ranting to the Dragonborn. He states that people have made false accusations towards him, although he calms down if he sees that the Dragonborn has no intention of harassing him. He then offers training in Conjuration along with some of his background knowledge, as well as selling spell tomes, mage robes, and soul gems.\r\nAfter speaking to Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone upon entering Morthal, she mentions that strange rumors are circulating in regard to Falion's activities at night. Falion has a conversation with his adopted daughter, where she claims to have had bad dreams of him fighting monsters while she slept. If the Dragonborn then waits outside of Falion's house until 01:00 AM, Falion can be seen walking into the marshes. Since Falion's specialty is Conjuration, he leads the Dragonborn to the Summoning Stones. Falion is startled when asked what he is doing there. 200 gold can be gained if the Dragonborn threatens to tell the Jarl. However, if one agrees not to mention his behavior to others, Falion will simply thank them and like them more.\r\nHead back to the Jarl of Morthal and inform her that Falion is being suspicious and she will say that she had a vision of this. From this point, she closely monitors his behavior, following him around everywhere, only leaving her post to eat or sleep.\r\nSpeaking with any innkeeper or member of the Dawnguard DG while afflicted with vampirism causes them to send the vampire to Falion. He agrees to cure their condition if one filled Black Soul Gem is brought to him. The Black Soul Gem must be filled with the Grand Soul of a dead humanoid mortal; anything else will not work. Upon doing so, he leads the vampire to the Summoning Stones where their affliction is cured. The ritual can be performed an unlimited number of times to cure a vampiric condition. If the Dragonborn does not have a Black Soul Gem, Falion will sell the Dragonborn an empty one . Occasionally, Falion can be pickpocketed for a Black Soul Gem, though the value of the gem makes it difficult.\r\nWhy set up shop in Morthal? \"As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place. My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed.\"\r\nWhat can you tell me about the area? \"The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.\"\r\nCan you teach me about Conjuration? \"You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.\"",
