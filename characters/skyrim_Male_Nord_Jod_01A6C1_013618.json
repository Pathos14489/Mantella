    "bio": "Jod is a Nord warrior serving as the Housecarl of Skald the Elder and the Guard Captain of the guard in Dawnstar.\r\nJod takes his duty and his loyalty to the town seriously.\r\nHe was an Imperial Legionnaire who fought in the Great War on a ship against the Thalmor, and seems to respect the Legion and its warriors, unlike Skald the Elder, his Jarl.\r\nJod: \"My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar.\" Skald: \"Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?\" Jod: \"You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders.\" Skald: \"Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.\" Jod: \"Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.\" Skald: \"I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod.\"",
