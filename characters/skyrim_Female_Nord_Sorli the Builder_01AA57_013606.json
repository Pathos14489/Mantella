    "bio": "Sorli the Builder is a Nord resident of Stonehills. She is the wife of Pactur, the overseer of Rockwallow Mine. Unlike the miners, who sleep in tents, Sorli lives in a cottage with Pactur and their son Sirgar. She will become Jarl of Hjaalmarch if the Stormcloaks liberate Morthal.\r\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War, Sorli replaces Idgrod Ravencrone as Jarl of Morthal. Upon being appointed with the new title, she takes up residence in Highmoon Hall with her husband Pactur as her Steward, and a worker from Stonehills, Teeba-Ei, serving as her housecarl. Bounties in the Hjaalmarch Hold can be collected directly from her.\r\n",
