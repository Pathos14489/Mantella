    "bio": "Thorolf is a bratty child living at The Mortar and Pestle in Dawnstar. The orphaned child of miners, he displays little concern over the death of his parents, but rather sees it as an opportunity to take advantage of his new guardian. Precocious and with a mind for business, Thorolf hopes to convert the Mortar and Pestle into a museum when its owner dies. The Mortar and Pestle is an alchemy shop in Dawnstar, and is owned by an old woman named Frida.",
