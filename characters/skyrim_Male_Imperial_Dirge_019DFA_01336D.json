    "bio": "Dirge, an Imperial man, is a gruff associate of the Thieves Guild in Riften. His brother Maul is Maven Black-Briar's right-hand man.\r\n\r\nDirge works as a bouncer for the Ragged Flagon, the underground tavern in the Ratway that the Guild uses as a base of operations. A man named Vekel is Dirge's employer. In the Ragged Flagon, Dirge can often be found in the front of the bar, or sitting down at one of the tables. He is quite muscular\r\n.\r\nDirge speaks impolitely. If the player asks why he's called Dirge, Dirge will explain that it's because a dirge is \"the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground\" and will then aggresively ask if the player has a problem with his name.\r\nDirge enjoys Black-Briar Mead. He often nibbles on a loaf of broad when not at his bouncer post. He wears a set of leather armor (without the helmet) and carries a steel war axe at his hip.\r\nHe often passively threatens people with death, telling them about what he did to the last person who messed with Vekel.\r\n",
