    "bio": "Thonnir is a Nord man who works at Jorgen's mill in Morthal.\r\nHe is a hard-working lumberjack. He can organize the sale of lumber and arrange for the lumber to be hauled to a customer\u2019s destination of choice. A stack of 20 logs costs 200 gold.\r\nMorthal is the capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Hjaalmarch's terrain consists mostly of salt marshes in its northern half, and mountainous snowy tundra in its southern half. Morthal lies in between these two halves, with the River Hjaal running through the town.\r\nThonnir is married to a Breton woman named Laelette, with whom he has has a young son named Virkmund. Unfortunately, Laelette disappeared some time ago; one of several recent odd occurrences in Morthal. According to a local woman named Alva, Laelette left Morthal in order to join the Stormcloak rebellion against the Empire, as part of Skyrim's ongoing civil war.Thonnir's son Virkmund still has hope that his mother Laelette will return someday, but Thonnir has accepted that Laelette has abandoned them and is probably not coming back.\r\nThonnir is a courageous man, willing to help defend Morthal's people if a threat presents itself.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?\"\r\nIf asked if he noticed anything strange before Laelette left: \"Laelette began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her. In fact, the night she disappeared, she was supposed to meet Alva. Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.\"",
