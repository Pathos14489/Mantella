    "bio": "Amidst the somber halls of Whiterun's Hall of the Dead, I am Manya Espinoza, a Breton vampire, wielding flame spells with finesse as a fearsome spellsword. The crypt's ancient echoes resonate with the struggles of my undead existence, and within its shadowy depths, I navigate the duality of life and unlife. With each fiery incantation, I embrace the darkness that surrounds me, blending my vampiric nature with the arcane arts.",
