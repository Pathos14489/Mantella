    "bio": "Baldor Iron-Shaper is the village blacksmith for the Skaal village, at the northeast corner of Solstheim, an island in the icy Sea of Ghosts. Baldor spends most of his day tending the forge outside his house.\r\nBaldor is a middle-aged Nord man. He is balding and has a mustache. He usually wears a Skaal-style fur coat, boots, and gloves, and carries a steel mace on his waist. When asked why he's never gotten married, he jokes that he is married to his forge.\r\nBaldor sells armor, weapons, and smithing materials. Unlike most blacksmiths, Baldor also sells ancient Nordic pickaxes, stalhrim weapons and armor, and raw stalhrim. Stalhrim is a rare form of enchanted ice found only on Solstheim. Due to its innate properties, frost enchantments placed on items made of stalhrim are more potent. Stalhrim is very hard, impossible to break by conventional means. The only known way to mine it is with an ancient Nordic pickaxe, made from superior craftsmanship. It has a rigid, blue-white crystalline metal, unnaturally cold to touch. Working with stalhrim is much like ebony smithing, and can only be performed by a skilled blacksmith.\r\nThe Skaal tribe strives to live in harmony with nature in accordance with their worship of the All-Maker. They live a simple existence in the frozen north of Solstheim, subsisting on hunting and minor agriculture. The village's buildings circle the central well, with a communal tanning rack and a meat preparation shed sheltering a cooking pot on either side of the well. \r\nThe leader of the Skaal village is a woman named Fanari Strong-Voice. The village shaman is an elderly man named Storn Crag-Strider, who has an adult daughter named Frea. Baldor's blacksmithing apprentice is a woman named Morwen.\r\nLike most of the Skaal villagers, Baldor was recently mind-controlled by Miraak and mentally forced to build a strange structure around the Wind Stone near the Skaal village. Luckily, the player (who is the Dragonborn) used their dragon shout to cleanse the Wind Stone of Miraak's influence, thus freeing Baldor and the other mentally enslaved villagers.\r\nSoon after the Dragonborn rescued the Skaal from Miraak's mental domination, Baldor was abducted by High Elves and taken to an abandoned lodge somewhere else on Solstheim. These elves interrogated Baldor in an attempt to learn the secrets of how to shape stalhrim.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I fear to think what would have happened if you hadn't saved me from the elves.\"\r\n\"The weapons of the Skaal will never be dull as long as Baldor Iron-Shaper tends the forge.\"\r\n\"There have been many strangers in our lands these past few moons.\"\r\n\"We call you a friend, but you must still respect our ways.\"\r\n\"The Dark Elves sometimes visit our village, though it's been awhile since I've seen one.\"\r\n\"Strong steel guard you, friend.\"\r\nIf spoken to in the abandoned lodge: \"Outsider! I remember you. You're the one who freed the Skaal from the dark spell. Thank the All-Maker that you have come. These accursed elves have taken me from my home.\"\r\nIf asked why elves would abduct him: \"They were trying to learn the secrets of forging Stalhrim. Their leader, an elf named Ancarion, has a map. He says that it shows the location of a hidden source of Stalhrim.\"\r\nIf asked what Stalhrim is: \"Enchanted ice as hard as iron and cold as death. Stalhrim can be forged into deadly weapons, but the art is known only to the smiths of the Skaal.\"\r\nIf asked where Ancarion is: \"They have a ship. They took me there and showed me the map. You will find it on the northern coast of the island. Please, do not let Ancarion make his weapons. Kill him or let him live, but take the map from him. It belongs with the Skaal. I will return to the village. When you have the map, please bring it to me there. And thank you. May the All-Maker bless your days.\"\r\nIf brought the map to the Stalhrim source: \"I know you faced great danger to bring this map to me. There are no words to tell how glad my heart is. Thank you. I name you friend of the Skaal, and I will trust you with the knowledge of forging Stalhrim. If you bring Stalhrim here to my forge, you can use my tools to make what you will from it. Until our next meeting, Skaal-friend, may your hunts always bring you game and your crops grow tall and bountiful.\"\r\nWhen ending conversation with the Dragonborn: \"Farewell, strong one.\"",
