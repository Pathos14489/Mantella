    "bio": "Torturer's Assistant is an Imperial legionnaire stationed in the town of Helgen. He is a well-built Imperial man with long dark hair, which is balding at the top. He wears a set of Imperial light armor. An iron mace is his weapon of choice, and he keeps one clipped to his belt.\r\nHe is currently in the bottom floor of the Helgen Keep, with his boss the Torturer standing nearby. He has just started hearing incredibly loud noises from outside the keep.\r\nThe Torturer is an old man (also an Imperial legionnaire) who is skilled with Destruction magic, and who is in quite good shape for his age. The Torturer is quite passionate about his study of torture, which he has recently been performing upon Stormcloak rebel prisoners.\r\nIf warned that a dragon is attacking Helgen, the Torturer\u2019s assistant will initially leave his boss and follow the player through the tunnels under Helgen in order to escape the destruction of the town. However, before escaping out of the tunnels, he will feel guilty about leaving his stubborn boss behind, and will then stop following the player and attempt to go back and convince his boss to escape Helgen\u2019s destruction with him.\r\nIf he sees any Stormcloak prisoners who have escaped their chains, he will attack them on sight.",
