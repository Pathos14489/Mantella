    "bio": "Vorstag is a Nord warrior who lives in Markarth. Found sitting by the fire in the Silver-Blood Inn.\r\nWhen traveling with the player, Vorstag is eager to investigate caves: \"Looks like a cave. Think we should check it out?\" However, he does not like mines, and, when taken inside one, comments on how they are dangerous and sometimes filled with poisonous gas.\r\nHe possesses knowledge about Dwemer artifacts, making comments on their trap-making skills whenever he enters Dwemer Ruins.\r\nThe player can hire Vorstag for 500 gold. After he has been hired once, Vorstag becomes a candidate for marriage.\r\nVorstag's highest skills are Heavy Armor, One-Handed, Archery and Block.\r\nVorstag wears a set of\u00a0scaled armor\u00a0by default, excluding the helm.\r\nVorstag may use his default Scaled Boots over other footwear. Even when the player gives him better light armor boots, he refuses to wear them. However, he wears any heavy armor boots deposited in his inventory. After the player has given Vorstag a better bow, sometimes he still chooses to use his default Hunting Bow.",
