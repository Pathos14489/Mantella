Each arrow nocked is a whisper of her solitude, a companion in the quiet vigil she keeps over a land that speaks to her in the rustling reeds and the cries of distant creatures.\r\n\r\n[Speak with the hushed tones of the marsh, where each word is as rare and as significant as the sighting of a ghostly wisp in the fog.]",
