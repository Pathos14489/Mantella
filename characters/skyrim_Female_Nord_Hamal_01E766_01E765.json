    "bio": "Hamal, also known as Mother Hamal, is the Nord High Priestess of the Temple of Dibella in the city of Markarth.\r\nWhen first met after breaking into the Inner Sanctum, she is holding a ritual where she attempts to gain guidance from Dibella about the goddess' new Sybil. She will gruffly speak to the player once she catches them, stating that they must \"serve penance\" for breaking into the Sanctum, thus starting \"The Heart of Dibella.\"\r\nAfter breaking into the Inner Sanctum (either to steal the Dibella Statue for Degaine, or simply entering at all), Hamal will accost the player, demanding that they pay penance for entering the restricted chamber. Though normally such penance is a term of servitude (for females) or outright death (for males), she will make an exception this time, as the Temple needs a new Sybil, and sends the player to fetch the new Sybil from Broken Tower Redoubt. After returning to the Temple with the new Sybil, Hamal directs the player to go pray at Dibella's shrine, from which they will gain the permanent blessing, Agent of Dibella.\r\nI've brought your Sybil. \"You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation. I will send word to her family that she is in good hands. You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift.\"",
