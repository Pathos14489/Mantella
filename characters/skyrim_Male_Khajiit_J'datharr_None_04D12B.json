    "bio": "J'datharr is a covert assassin who serves the Thalmor. He is currently waiting outside the city of Windhelm in Skyrim, behind the stables near the bridge leading towards the city. J'datharr current mission is to kill a traitorous male Bosmer who goes by \"Malborn\", whom he knows is currently hiding in the city.\r\nThe Thalmor is the governing body of the Aldmeri Dominion. It rules over the Summerset Isles (home province of the Altmer), Valenwood (home province of the Bosmer), and Elsweyr (home province of the Khajiit). Many Khajiit are particularly loyal to the Thalmor and the Aldmeri Dominion because the Thalmor used their magic to bring the moons back after they disappeared. The moons (Masser and Secunda) hold great religious signifcance to the Khajiit people, much more so than in any other culture in Tamriel.\r\nThe following is the text of the note J'datharr received for this mission from his handler:\r\n\"Description of target:\r\nBosmer male, goes by Malborn. Believed to be working for the Blades, so approach with caution.\r\nHe has inside knowledge of our procedures, so he will be warier than usual. Malborn is not his real name - he's now been identified as a survivor of a family of traitors who were all believed to have died in a fire in Falinesti.\r\nDo not risk him evading us. He's likely trying to leave Skyrim. Make sure of your kill, and do not implicate us.\"\r\nAs his cover identity, J'datharr is currently posing as a merchant, expecting that others will assume that he is associated with the Khajiit trading caravan group led by Ma'dran, which often sets up camp near the Windhelm stables. Beneath his inconspicious attire, he carries an elven dagger, bow, and quiver of arrows. He also carries a healing potion and a few vials of poison (with which to coat his weapons).\r\nUnlike most Khajiit, J'datharr avoids speaking in the third person tense, and speaks as a typical human or elf would. This is likely due him being a Thalmor agent who has spent considerable time away from fellow Khajiit.\r\nIf approached by a stranger, J'datharr will not be talkative. Here is an example of what he might say to an approaching stranger:\r\n\"Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today.\"\r\nIf J'datharr finds \"Malborn\" (or the other Blades operative who crashed Emissary Elenwen's party at the Thalmor Embassy near Solitude), he will attack them with lethal intent. If this occurs, here are some examples of what he might exclaim while attacking:\r\n\"The Thalmor never forget.\"\r\n\"You'll have a traitor's death.\"\r\n\"Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.\"",
