    "bio": "Ingrid, a Nord woman, lived in Helgen before it was destroyed by a mighty black dragon, which breathed fire and rained meteors upon the town until it was reduced to rubble. She is a staunch supporter of the Empire in the civil war against the Stormcloak rebellion. Shortly before the dragon attacked Helgen, General Tullius, the military governor of Skyrim, marched into town with a company of Imperial soldiers, with many Stormcloak prisoners (including their traitorous leader, Ulfric Stormcloak) in tow. They unfortunately only managed to execute one of the Stormcloak prisoners before the dragon attacked, allowing the rest of the Stormcloaks to escape.",
