    "bio": "Gergus Malumea is an elderly farmer living with his wife Cindaia in Applewatch, where he manages the brewing of the famous Applewatch cider. Applewatch is a small farming town west of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. Gergus is widely regarded as the pillar of the community. However, lately he has been distraught, often exclaiming \"Gah, where did Red Diamond run off to?\" Red Diamond is his precious horse. \r\nGergus may ask for help in slaying a dangerous wolf that has made its lair nearby. He may also ask for help delivering an order of cider to the Jerall View Inn in the nearby city of Bruma. \r\nDuring the day, in addition to tasks relating to producing the cider, Gergus performs tasks such as feeding the chickens. On Sundas (Sunday), he enjoys a long dinner with his wife and his son Aebond's family. \r\nExamples of Gergus' dialogue towards visiting travelers: \r\n\"Welcome to Applewatch. Make yourself at home.\" \r\n\"We're a small place with small offerings. Nothing here for troublemakers.\" \r\n\"This cider doesn't make itself!\" \r\n\"We work hard, and we prosper.\" \r\nIf asked about the village: \"Applewatch? Just a humble apple orchard, and a humble family turning those apples into cider for the people of Cyrodiil. Nothing glamorous.\" \r\nIf an adventurer ask if he has any work: \"Work, eh? Well, we've got nothing fancy. No exciting adventures or mighty beasts to slay. But we can always use a bit of help gathering apples for our cider. Tell you what. I'll pay you for any apples you bring me from the orchard.\"",
