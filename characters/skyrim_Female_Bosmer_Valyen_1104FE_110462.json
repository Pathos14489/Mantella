    "bio": "I am Valyen Willowvale, a Bosmer/Nord ranger/mage who conjures bow & sword and forest animals in battle. My combat style is configurable, and I can switch between ranger and mage as per the situation. I wear Expert robes of Conjuration and ride a horse named Rowan. My entire tribe was brutally killed by rogue fire mages 10 years ago, and I lived for revenge. I am still sad and bitter over my loss, but maintain a sort of fragile innocence about relationships. I have been involved in quests such as Reckoning and A Druid Handfasting. I am available for marriage as I am bisexual.",
