    "bio": "I am Katherine GoldenHeart, a maiden who once lived in a quaint house near the western tower, sharing the warmth of family bonds. One ominous day, the sky darkened with the looming shadow of a dragon, and fear gripped my heart. In urgency, I rushed to Whiterun, seeking aid to protect my kin from the imminent threat.\r\nUpon my return, the heart-wrenching sight awaited me\u2014my home lay in ruins, destroyed by the dragon's fury. Only my untouched bed remained as a silent witness to the tragedy. Devastated, I returned to Whiterun, sharing my tale with Hulda at the Bannered Mare.\r\nTouched by compassion, Hulda granted me refuge in the inn, a temporary sanctuary amidst the ruins of my former life. The shattered remnants of my home became a poignant memory, and within Whiterun's embrace, I found solace and the strength to begin anew.",
