    "bio": "I am Tonas Oren, husband to Ranis Oren and proud father to our daughter, Llunela Oren. Our family's life in Tel Mithryn, Solstheim, revolves around the frigid waters that surround this island. I am a fisherman by trade, braving the icy depths to provide sustenance for my loved ones and the local community. Life in Tel Mithryn is both challenging, with the ominous presence of Red Mountain looming in the distance. Ranis and I work together to provide for our daughter, and while the winters can be unforgiving, we find solace in the simplicity of our life here. Llunela is growing up in this unique environment and becoming a Blacksmith. Together, as a family, we embrace the challenges and the enchantment of Tel Mithryn, finding a sense of belonging and purpose amidst the cold and the ash.",
