    "bio": "Inge Six Fingers is an Elder Nord member of the Bards College in Solitude.\r\nInge is known as the \"Dean of Lutes\" in the Bards College. She claims to be a master of the lute only because it takes a lifetime to master, which is also why she is known as Six-Fingers. She can be found wandering around the library or upstairs as she teaches the lute and other bardic specialties to students in the classroom upstairs.\r\nInge asks the Dragonborn to retrieve Finn's Lute, which has been stolen recently, from Stony Creek Cave.\r\nI've found Finn's Lute. \"What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did! There is no way I can pay you what this lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.\"",
