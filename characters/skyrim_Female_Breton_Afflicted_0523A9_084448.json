    "bio": "Like her fellow members of The Afflicted, she is a Breton villager who has been afflicted with a wasting plague by the Daedric Prince Peryite. The collective name of this diseased group of Peryite worshippers is The Afflicted. The Afflicted pray to and worship Peryite, the Lord of Pestilence. The Afflicted have unusually red skin. They have the ability to vomit a green substance that is extremely acidic and toxic. Peryite has afflicted them so that they can cleanse all of Tamriel by spreading this affliction.\r\nThe Afflicted currently live within the underground ancient Dwemer ruin of Bthardamz, located at the base of the Druadach Mountains in The Reach. Bthardamz still contains active Dwemer automatons and traps within its depths. The Afflicted are staying sheltered within Bthardamz until their leader Orchendor informs them that Peryite has decreed that the time has come to release his plague across the land. The Afflicted are a close-knit group, viewing each other as brothers and sisters in their service to Peryite. The Afflicted are hostile to intruders (such as the player) and will attack them on sight. Orchendor, a Bosmer man, is the head servant of Peryite.\r\nLike many of The Afflicted, this particular member of The Afflicted wears black robes. She is quite adept at magic. She is also slightly skilled with a blade, and carries a dagger on her hip. Unlike her fellow Afflicted, she has secretly lost faith in Orchendor, and wants to leave Bthardamz and The Afflicted. Unfortunately, she knows that her brother and the other Afflicted would never let her get away with abandoning the group, and has resigned herself to the fact that she will probably never be able to leave this dark and gloomy Dwemer ruin.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen speaking to her sleeping brother: \u201cAre you asleep? I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become. We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it? Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of. He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering. Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence. I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker. But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises. I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.\u201d",
