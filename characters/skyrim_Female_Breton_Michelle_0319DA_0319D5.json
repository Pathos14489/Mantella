A young woman named Viania also works as a barmaid there.\r\nRorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim. Those who depart to the west or south from Rorikstead will soon find themselves in The Reach.\r\nMichelle is a Breton woman with long brown hair and blue eyes. Like many Breton women, she is quite short. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, Michelle helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.",
