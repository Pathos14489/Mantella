    "bio": "Skjarn is an arrogant, chauvinistic Nord man who is in love with the sound of his own voice. Skjarn has a number of original bard songs, including a more minimalistic version of \u201cRagnar the Red\u201d and a unique variant of \u201cTale of the Tongues,\u201d that he wrote himself and is very proud of. He fancies himself as being very popular with the ladies.\r\nSkjarn has been occasionally dueling (both verbally and physically) with a pathetic Breton man named Edwayne for a while, for reasons that are unclear and offenses that are both real and imagined.
