He seems to take a particular interest in Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince worshipped by the Mythic Dawn during the Oblivion Crisis. He is also proud of his family's involvement in the cult, despite it ending the Septim Dynasty and very nearly bringing about the end of the world.\r\nHe lives in Dawnstar, where he operates a museum inside his home that features a number of Mythic Dawn artifacts in locked display cases.\r\n",
