    "bio": "Orc Hunters are hostile Orsimer in Skyrim that can be randomly encountered in certain places throughout Skyrim. They are generally hostile, even to an Orcish Dragonborn. They most often wear full iron armor and use steel war axes, long bows and iron arrows to hunt their prey. They will become hostile if one walks too close to them, but will immediately attack if the Dragonborn begins to hunt nearby animals. If they are killed in public, the Dragonborn will receive a large bounty.",
