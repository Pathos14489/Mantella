    "bio": "Stalleo can be found outside of Treva's Watch.\r\nStalleo is a Nord who can be found outside on the east side of Treva's Watch, and offers the quest \"Infiltration.\" Even after the quest is completed, he can often be found in the campsite just outside the fort.\r\nStalleo once lived with his family in Treva's Watch, their personal castle. After High King Torygg died there was bad blood between Stalleo and his rival Brurid. Eventually he, along with his men, left to help in the ongoing war between the Imperials and rebel Stormcloaks. While doing so, Brurid and a larger group of bandits took over his castle. Stalleo mentions that he attempted retaking the castle with his men, but it went \"sour,\" as he describes it to the Dragonborn. All that is left of his men is Stalleo and two of his bodyguards.\r\nThe Dragonborn is asked to infiltrate Treva's Watch and help Stalleo and his bodyguards retake the fort.\r\nWhat's going on here? \"Finally, reinforcements have arrived. I was expecting more though, you'd better be good.\"",
