    "bio": "Nura Snow-Shod is a\u00a0Nord priestess of Talos residing in the city of Riften. She is a member of the Snow-Shod clan.\r\nShe is the wife of Vulwulf Snow-Shod, and the mother of Asgeir Snow-Shod and Unmid Snow-Shod. Before her daughter, Lilija, joined the Stormcloaks, she instructed her in the healing arts. Normally, she tends the Shrine of Talos in Riften, but if the city is captured by the Imperials in the Civil War or given to them during \"Season Unending,\" she will no longer appear there, but will remain confined to Snow-Shod Manor instead.\r\nNura Snow-Shod \"You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.\" Vulwulf Snow-Shod \"It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?\" Nura Snow-Shod \"That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.\" Vulwulf Snow-Shod \"You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people, to fight to keep us free. You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land. No, I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste.\"",
