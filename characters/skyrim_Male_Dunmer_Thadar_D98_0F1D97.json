    "bio": "Thadar lives in the Gray Quarter of Windhelm. He is a frequent patron of the New Gnisis Cornerclub. In Dunmer culture, a cornerclub is analogous to an inn/tavern. This cornerclub is run by Ambarys Rendar and his subordinate, Malthyr Elenil. Like the vast majority of the Gray Quarter's population, everyone who works at this cornerclub is a Dunmer. Most of the patrons, including Thadar, are also Dunmer.",
