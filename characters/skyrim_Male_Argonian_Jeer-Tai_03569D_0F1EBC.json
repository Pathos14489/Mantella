    "bio": "Jeer-Tai lives in Whiterun. He is an Argonian. He works at his food stall along a main road in the Plains District of the city, near a tavern called The Drunken Hunstman. He sells a variety of cheeses, other dairy products, and some soups and stews.\r\nJeer-Tai lives with his lover, a male Dunmer named Daynil. Daynil is also a vendor, selling Dunmer-style food and drinks at his stall up in the Wind District. The interior of their house is much more similar to a residence in Morrowind than to a standard dwelling in Skyrim. Conveniently, it is very close to Jeer-Tai's food stall.",
