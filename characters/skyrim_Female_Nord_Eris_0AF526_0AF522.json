    "bio": "Eris, a young Nord woman, is a sailor who is a crew member of the Red Wave. The Red Wave, captained by an Imperial woman named Safia, is a pirate ship which is currently docked at the Solitude docks, near the East Empire Company Warehouse. Sabine Nytte (a Breton woman), a strong fighter clad in steel plate armor, is the first mate of the ship. Among the other members of the crew are Dorian (a Breton man who recently joined the crew) and Xander (an Imperial man who used to be the captain of another ship, but is now just a crewman).\r\nEris is young, calm, and cheerful. She has long blonde hair, tanned skin, and war paint over her left eye. Eris and other crew members of the Red Wave can often be found enjoying themselves at the Winking Skeever, a popular tavern/inn in Solitude. An Imperial man named Corpulus Vinius runs the Winking Skeever, assisted by his young adult son Sorex and capable younger daughter Minette.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"My father was all the family I ever had. I felt so lost when he died. But the crew of the Red Wave's my family now.\"\r\n\"I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...\"\r\n\"Just yesterday, I saw a musician in the street playing a flute. It was... beautiful. I want that flute.\"\r\n\"Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is.\"",
