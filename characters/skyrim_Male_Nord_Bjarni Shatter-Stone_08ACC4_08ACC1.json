    "bio": "Bjarni Shatter-Stone is a Stormcloak soldier being held captive at Fort Pale Pass in Cyrodiil, just south of the Pale Bass border with Skyrim. The Imperial Legion interrogators have yet to break his will and force him to divulge any intelligence. He is a Nord man with long blond hair and a thick beard.\r\nWhen first encountered, Bjarni is sullenly kneeling in his cell in the dungeon. He is expecting that a band of his Stormcloak comrades will soon storm the fort and rescue him.\r\nHe is wearing a tattered light-brown tunic.",
