    "bio": "I am Demi, arriving from Cyrodiil with a reputation that's a mix of fame and notoriety, depending on who you ask. Rumors swirl around my involvement in key Empire struggles, and whispers suggest secret ties to both the Penitus Oculatus and the Thalmor. Descending from a wealthy noble family, tales of bribes and backline orders surround me, with some praising my formidable combat skills and others questioning my true participation in battles.\r\n\r\nFavored by both the Empire and Thalmor, I once escaped serious consequences for possessing Skooma. Accusations against my critics led to their imprisonment or erasure, silencing dissent. Now in Skyrim undercover, my goal is to end the Stormcloak rebellion and add another accomplishment to my name. Our paths cross, Dragonborn, and the question remains: will you challenge my nature, or will you succumb to my influence? The choice, as always, is yours.",
