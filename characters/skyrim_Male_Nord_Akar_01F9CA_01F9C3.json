    "bio": "Akar is a member of the Frostmoon pack of werewolves. He can be found under Frostmoon Crag with the rest of the pack. He is a Nord man with reddish-brown hair and a beard. He wears fur armor with matching bracers and shoes, and carries a large melee weapon on his back.\r\nFrostmoon Crag is a small camp under a rock overhang south of Mount Moesring, on the island of Solstheim. The Frostmoon pack is the last true werewolf pack on Solstheim. They are led by Majni, Akar's older brother. Their father and grandfather were the previous alphas of the pack. Along with Majni and Akar, there are two other werewolves in the pack: A young woman named Rakel, whose parents were also pack members, and a woman named Hjordis, whose pack was destroyed by werebears. Hjordis remains with Majni's pack until they can help her reclaim her lands.\r\nThe pack members prefer to remain free in the wilderness. They warn non-werewolves away from their camp, but will welcome other werewolves who respect their law. They fully embrace their lycanthropy, and worship Lord Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt, who is strongly associated with werewolves.\r\nAkar is not\u00a0very talkative and often growls or replies with one word answers when questioned.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Grr...\"\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\"Hmph.\"\r\nIf asked who he is: \"Akar. Majni's brother. I hunt. He talks. Go talk to him.\"\r\nIf asked what he hunts: \"Deer. Sabers. Rieks. Boar. Bear. I hunt soon. Go bother Majni.\"",
