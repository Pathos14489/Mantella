    "bio": "I am Vassi Ice Tooth and I stand alongside my husband, Avaang Ice Tooth, in this relentless struggle for Skyrim's freedom. We were among the first to take up arms. The Thalmor took my sister prisoner for her Talos worship early on. Now, many Thalmor agents have met their end by my hand but I have yet to find my sister or confirm her alive. During the daring infiltration of Fort Snowhawk, it was Avaang who led the charge, dismantling their defenses with his expert axe work. His battle cries and strength were awe-inspiring. I fought fiercely by his side, ensuring no Imperial or Thalmor could escape our fury. Together, we proudly unfurled the Stormcloak banner atop the battlements, sending a chilling message across the waters to those Imperial scum in Solitude. I hoped to find my sister in Snowhawk, but sadly she was not there. While I certainly appreciate the skill that Avaang brings to this blacksmithing, my focus lies more in scouting and navigation. My talents have often served us well on reconnaissance missions, ensuring our comrades have the upper hand in battle.",
