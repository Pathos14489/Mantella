    "bio": "Eimar works as the junior assistant at the Honningbrew Meadery. Eimar\u2019s dream is to someday become the owner of the meadery. He is a young Nord man with blond hair and green eyes. He spends his working hours cleaning the meadery and sometimes tasting the mead. He is quite happy with his job.\r\nHonningbrew Meadery is located near the city of Whiterun. Multiple rivers, stone bridges, and farms surround the area around the meadery.\r\nA midde-aged man named Sabjorn is the founder and owner the Honningbrew Meadery. Honningbrew is a newly established competitor to the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften, which is owned by Maven Black-Briar. Maven is unhappy about her new competition, and she wants to buy out or otherwise eliminate Honninbrew as a competitor. The Honningbrew Meadery is small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Sabjorn\u2019s senior assistant is an Imperial man named Mallus Maccius. While Mallus often complains about how hard Sabjorn makes him work, Eimar doesn\u2019t think that Sabjorn makes either of them work too hard.\r\nIf Maven Black-Briar is successful in her attempts to acquire ownership of the Honningbrew Meadery from Sabjorn, Eimar will be somewhat disheartened and less enthusiastic about his job, since the meadery will then have to start selling inferior Black-Briar mead. If Maven\u2019s attempted acquisition is successful, Mallus will become the new manager of the meadery.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now, and look at it.\"\r\n\"Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day.\"\r\nIf inside the Honningbrew Meadery: \"If you need to sample some of the finest mead in Skyrim, you're in the right place.\"",
