We own everything in this city, even the jail.\r\n\"I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind when you're speaking to me.\"\r\n\u201cMy husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.\"\r\n\"I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it.\"\r\n\u201cThonar is the real head of this family.
