    "bio": "Valdr is a Nord hunter from the town of Falkreath found sitting outside Moss Mother Cavern.\r\nHe asks that the Dragonborn clear out the cave of spriggans so he can get to the bodies of his fallen friends. He and his hunting party, Ari and Niels, tracked a bear to the cave. While inside, they cornered the bear but were suddenly attacked by three spriggans.\r\nWhen speaking with him, a miscellaneous quest \"Heal Valdr's injuries\" is given. Valdr can be healed by using either potions or a spell like Healing Hands. After he is healed, he asks that the spriggans in the cave be cleared out so that he can reclaim the bodies of his fallen friends.\r\nFor completing the task, Valdr awards Valdr's Lucky Dagger, which was a lucky gift given to him by Ari. Valdr indicates that he will return to Falkreath, but only after burying his friends.",
