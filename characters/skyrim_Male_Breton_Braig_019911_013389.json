    "bio": "Braig, a Breton Reachman, is a member of the Forsworn rebellion who has been imprisoned for years in Cidhna Mine, the prison in Markarth where the inmates are forced to undergo hard labor as miners. He is balding and has long gray hair with a thick mustache. He was originally thrown in the prison because he was caught speaking with Madanach (also known as the King in Rags), the leader of the Forsworn Rebellion, before the Nords crushed the rebellion and regained control of Markarth and The Reach hold. Just before Braig was imprisoned, his young daughter Aethra begged Jarl Hrolfdir to take her instead. The Jarl's men then beheaded Aethra in front of Braig, and sent him as a prisoner to Cidhna Mine anyway. Aethra would be 23 years old now if she was still alive.\r\nBraig will only tell the player the story about his daughter\u2019s death if the player tells him that Madanach has requested him to tell his story.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cEveryone in Cidhna Mine has a tale. Let's hear yours first. When was the first time you felt chains around your wrists?\"\r\nWhen telling his story: \"I had a daughter, once. She'd be 23 this year. Married to some hot-headed silver worker or maybe on her own learning the herb trade. The Nords didn't care who was and who wasn't involved in the Forsworn Uprising. I had spoken to Madanach once, that was enough. But my little Aethra didn't want to see her papa leave her. She pleaded to the Jarl to take her instead. And after they made me watch as her head rolled off the block, they threw me in here anyway, to dig up their silver.\"\r\n\"I'm not Madanach. I was never a leader of the Forsworn. The only anger I can justify is my own. But every family in the Reach has a story like mine. There are no innocent onlookers in this struggle. Just the guilty, and the dead.\"\r\n\u201cI'm just a poor Forsworn whose only regret is not killing more Nords before I was locked up.\"\r\n\"Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it.\"\r\n\"What do you want? Have digging to do.\"\r\n\"Glory to the Forsworn!\"",
