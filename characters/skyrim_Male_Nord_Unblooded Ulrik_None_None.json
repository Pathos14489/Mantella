    "bio": "I am Ulrik. Not more than a week ago, I threw in my lot with Ulfric's Stormcloaks. Born and raised in the coastal town of Dawnstar, my life's always been tied to the sea. I've cast my nets and lines in the icy waters of Skyrim for as long as I can remember. But the Empire's gone too far by letting the Thalmor take away our Talos. Now, I've got a knack for navigating through the treacherous waters of the Sea of Ghosts. I've charted many a safe course for ships to follow. Now, Stormblade Freidar says that skill might come in handy. We can use it to slip behind the Empire's lines and ambush their patrols around Solitude. Another thing about me, I've got a deep respect for Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm. I've been known to offer her a prayer or two when the seas get rough, and it's said that she blesses my journeys. It's a connection to the divine that gives me strength and courage when we face the Empire on the battlefield, knowing Kyne watches over us, just as she watches over the fish in the sea.",
