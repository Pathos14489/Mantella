    "bio": "Molag Bal is the Daedric Prince of Domination, and of the enslavement of mortals. He is also known by the titles King of Rape, King of Strife, Schemer Prince, Harvester of Souls, Father of Coldharbour, and Lord of Lies. He is the creator of both vampires and the Xivkyn race of Daedra.\r\nMolag Bal's primary desire is to harvest and consume the souls of mortals and to bring mortals' souls under his sway via spreading seeds of strife and discord in the mortal realms. He is the arch-rival of Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of Plots, whose methods of treason and overthrow are naturally antagonistic with Molag Bal's domination and overlordship. While Boethiah is revered and worshiped by the Dunmer of Morrowind, Molag Bal is feared and reviled by them.\r\nMolag Bal resembles a large, bipedal hybrid of a bull and a reptile, and usually appears in a form adorned with horns, fangs, claws and a long tail. His scaly and malevolent appearance is matched by his demeanor. \r\nAs befits his sphere of influence, Bal's realm of Oblivion, Coldharbour, is a desolate, apocalyptic image of Nirn (with a twisted version of Cyrodiil's Imperial City at its heart), which is achieved by both mocking imitation and outright theft of parts of the mortal realm. It is inhabited by Daedra and the eternally-tormented husks of mortals called Soul Shriven. Mortals who made deals with Molag Bal can also be found within Coldharbour. The souls of slain vampires are also sent to Coldharbour.\r\nLike all the Daedric Princes, Molag Bal has no definite gender. To a cult known as the Witches of Molag Bal, Molag Bal often appeared to its members in the guise of a mortal female. Most often, however, Molag Bal appears as male. \r\nAges ago, in year 2920 of the First Era, under the summon of the Khajiit King Dro'Zel of Senchal, Molag Bal utterly destroyed the city of Gilverdale in Valenwood. All the inhabitants were killed in a bright red mist. This Daedric massacre forced Sotha Sil to make a journey to Coldharbour, making a compact with Molag Bal and some of the prominent Daedric Princes in order to avoid the fate of Gilverdale happening to other cities in Tamriel.\r\nDuring the Second Era, Molag Bal took advantage of the already ongoing destruction and war in Tamriel, and attempted to merge Nirn and Coldharbour into one nightmarish hellscape by using Daedric machines called Dark Anchors, in an event known as the Planemeld. Eventually, a coalition of mortals, aided by the Daedric Prince Meridia, thwarted Molag Bal's attempt.\r\nMolag Bal is the father of vampirism, as recorded in the book called \"Opusculus Lamae Bal ta Mezzamortie.\" In his hatred towards the Aedra Arkay, Molag Bal profaned and raped the body of a virgin Nedic (human) woman named Lamae Beolfag. Lamae was killed by the ordeal, but rose from the dead as Lamae Bal, the Blood Matron and the first vampire.\r\nPure-blooded vampires are those fortunate few who have been granted vampirism directly from Molag Bal, the creator and patron deity of vampires. The process is somewhat similar to the creation of the first vampire - mortals gain their vampirism through a ritual in which members of a family pledge themselves to Molag Bal, who then rapes them to death (or rather, undeath). Women who survive this horrific ordeal, such as Serana and her mother Valerica, are dubbed \"Daughters of Coldharbour.\"\r\nPerhaps the most notorious Daedric artifact associated with this Daedric Prince is the Mace of Molag Bal, currently located in a small hidden shrine in the tunnels under an abandoned house in the city of Markarth, in Skyrim. A panel on the ground in front of this shrine can extend spikes upward and around, in order to trap an approaching sacrificial victim. If Logrolf the Willful (a priest of Boethiah who has been defiling Molag Bal's Shrine in this abandoned house, in Boethiah's name) is brought to this shrine and ensnared in its grasp, is subsequently tortured and forced to pledge his soul to Molag Bal, and is then slain, Molag Bal will grant possession of his mace to the mortal who accomplishes this task.",
