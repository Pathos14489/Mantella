    "bio": "Elrindir is a Bosmer merchant in Skyrim who owns The Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun with his brother Anoriath.\r\nOne night, whilst under the influence of some mead, Elrindir and his brother went out hunting; however, in his drunken state, Anoriath mistook Elrindir for a deer and fired an arrow into his rump. Thus, the two brothers decided upon the humorous moniker \"Drunken Huntsman\" for their hunting shop.\r\nIf following the Dark Brotherhood side quests, the Dragonborn may be tasked with killing his brother. If this has been done, he will sometimes begin dialogue by saying, \"Something you need, you miserable wretch?\" even if his brother was killed in secret.\r\nHe will also use unique dialogue depending on the Dragonborn's race. Elrindir gives no other indication that he is upset about his brother's death and will not send thugs after his killer.\r\nA radiant quest from Vilkas, the Dragonborn is sent to a random location to rescue Elrindir.\r\nErlindir has been causing trouble for someone around Whiterun. The Dragonborn is sent to rough him up to remind him of his obligations and return to Farkas when it is done.",
