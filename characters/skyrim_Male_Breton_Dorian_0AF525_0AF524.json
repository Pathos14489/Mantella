    "bio": "Dorian, a Breton man, is a sailor with the Red Wave crew. He has light red hair, and wears leather armor.\r\nThe Red Wave, captained by an Imperial woman named Safia, is a pirate ship which is currently docked at the Solitude docks, near the East Empire Company Warehouse. Sabine Nytte (a Breton woman), a strong fighter clad in steel plate armor, is the first mate of the ship. Among the other members of the crew are Eris (a pretty and cheerful young Nord woman) and Xander (an Imperial man who used to be the captain of another ship, but is now just a crewman).\r\nDorian enjoys quiet and calm seas, as well as reading books. However, his rugged look, his loyalty (to the ship, crew, and its captain), and his determination to kill anyone that steps into the Red Wave's way still makes Dorian a dangerous man. Dorian is a fan of the famous author Adonato Leotelli, and wants to meet him someday.\r\nWhile Dorian enlisted with the Red Wave crew only recently, he has previous sailing experience.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy.\"\r\n\"I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.\"\r\n\"Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you.\"\r\n\"You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.\"\r\n\"I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way.\"",
