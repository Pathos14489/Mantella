    "bio": "Name's Ginvur Nedalin. You see, I'm a Dark Elf swordsman, and I've made Solstheim my home, at least as much as any wanderer like me can call any place home.\r\nThe Retching Netch has been my haunt for as long as I can remember. It ain't much, but it's where I hang my worn armor and trusty blade. Life here on Solstheim ain't easy. The land is harsh, and the skies are perpetually gray. But it's got its own beauty, in a rugged, untamed sort of way.\r\nI make my living as a sword for hire. There's always some trouble brewing on this island \u2013 whether it's those blasted Ash Spawn, crazed Reavers, or just the cold that can freeze the marrow in your bones. I take on odd jobs, guard caravans, and occasionally delve into some ancient Dwemer ruins looking for forgotten treasures. It's a dangerous life, but it suits me just fine.\r\nNow, let's talk about that so-called god Vivec. The Red Mountain disaster, it's what brought me here in the first place. The eruption destroyed my homeland, Vvardenfell and scattered my people far and wide. Vivec's so-called divinity didn't save us, did it? In fact, his abandonment of us caused this eruption, after that it was every Dunmer for themselves for decades.\r\nSolstheim may be harsh, but at least it's a place where I can live by my own rules and swing my sword as I see fit. And let me tell you, if I ever run into that so-called god. I'll be looking to put him down.",
