    "bio": "Evelyna wants to study at the Bards College in Solitude. She is a Dunmer.\r\nEvelyna has been playing as a member of a trio of bards at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in the Grey Quarter of Windhelm, along with a young Breton woman named Roxelle and an Argonian woman named Beeele. This cornerclub/tavern is run by a Dunmer man named Ambarys Rendar, and is mostly frequented by the Dunmer who live in the Grey Quarter of the city.\r\nIf Evelyna's application to the Bard's College in Solitude (the provincial capital of Skyrim) is accepted, she will move to Solitude and become a student at the college. She will request for the player to escort her on this long journey to Solitude. After having moved to Solitude, Evelyna will often play in the Winking Skeever tavern in Solitude.\r\nEvelyna has a kind and upbeat demeanor. She is fond of the player, and is willing to follow them on adventures. She sometimes fondly refers to the player as \"captain\".",
