    "bio": "Varnius Junius is a farmer\u00a0who lives in the town of Dragon Bridge.\r\nHe is a relatively young Imperial man. He usually wears a bright set of merchant-style clothing. He has short red hair and a short beard.\r\nVarnius is first encountered speaking to Jarl Elisif and her court, within the Blue Palace in Solitude. Varnius can be seen speaking with the court (particularly the court steward, a man named Falk Firebeard) regarding his worries about something bad happening at Wolfskull Cave, in the mountainous area north of Dragon Bridge.\r\nThe town of Dragon Bridge is located in Haafingar, southwest of the city of Solitude. Solitude is the provincial capital of Skyrim. To the southeast of Dragon Bridge there is a long stone bridge that spans the chasm overlooking the Karth River, which marks the boundary between Haafingar and Hjaalmarch holds. The town is named after this bridge.\r\nVarnius generally spends a lot of time in the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge, which is run by a woman named Faida. Faida is assisted at the tavern by a teenage Breton girl named Julienne Lylvieve.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!\"\r\n\"I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave.\"\r\n\"Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge.\"\r\n\"Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.\"",
