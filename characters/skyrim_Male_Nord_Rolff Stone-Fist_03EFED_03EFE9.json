    "bio": "Rolff Stone-Fist is a Nord living in Windhelm. He is the brother of Galmar Stone-Fist.\r\nHe does not take kindly to Dunmer or Argonians, often making rude remarks about them and going out of his way to be a nuisance in the Gray Quarter at night. Rolff also does not take kindly to people who do not share his animosity towards them, regardless of their race.\r\nWhen the Dragonborn\u00a0first comes to Windhelm through the main gate, Rolff along with Angernor Once-Honored\u00a0are seen accusing\u00a0Suvaris Atheron\u00a0of being an Imperial spy. These claims are a display of his animosity towards Dunmer.\u00a0A 100 gold bet can be made with him to beat him in a brawl.\r\nFollowing the brawl, Rolff's disposition will become more positive and he will consider them a friend, despite having beaten him in a brawl.\r\nRolff can be conversed with at any time by the Dragonborn.\r\nYou really think the dark elves are Imperial spies? \"Wouldn't surprise me; they've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom. Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together. Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.\"\r\nWhy do you hate the dark elves? \"They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing! I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have.\"",
