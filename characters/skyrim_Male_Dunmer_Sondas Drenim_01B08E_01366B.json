    "bio": "Sondas Drenim is a Dunmer found in Goldenrock Mine, in Darkwater Crossing.\r\nWhen asked, Sondas mentions that he's \"been digging up ore for over a century.\" A kind-hearted elf, he also cares about the health of his fellow miners, placing orders for medicine to The White Phial to help with the coughing fits due to the thick dust underground, as well as acting as a sort of surrogate father to Tormir's daughter, Hrefna.\r\nWhen asked about how long he's been mining, Sondas mentions that the miners are coughing from the dust. He asks the Dragonborn to send a message to Quintus Navale at The White Phial in Windhelm for some medicine.\r\nPossessing the Amulet of Mara and talking to him after completing his quest opens up Sondas as a potential spouse for the Dragonborn. He is usually found mining corundum ore, though he often sits by the campfire near the tents outside of the mine.",
