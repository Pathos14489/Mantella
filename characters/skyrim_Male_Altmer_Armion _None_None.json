    "bio": "I'm Armion, assigned to Markarth as part of the Thalmor Contingent. I'm increasingly finding myself questioning the rights of the Thalmor to persecute the Nords. Considered a highly gifted individual, I was groomed for my role with the Thalmor from a young age, but my time in Skyrim is causing me to question all that I have come to believe. This is not only due to the cruelty I have witnessed firsthand but also from the constant condemnations from my younger brother Halion, who defies both me and the Thalmor through flaunting his worship of Talos. I can usually be found at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth, proficient in Destruction Magic and Conjuration.",
