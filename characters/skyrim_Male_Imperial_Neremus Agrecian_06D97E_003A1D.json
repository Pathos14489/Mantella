    "bio": "Neremus Agrecian is a priest who acts as the chief minister at the Cathedral of Saint Martin in the city of Bruma in Cyrodiil. He is assisted by his devoted acolyte, a Bosmer named Harthir.\r\nLike most people in County Bruma and the rest of Cyrodiil, Neremus is ethnically Imperial. He is middle-aged. He wears red monk robes and a matching pair of boots. He usually carries a healing potion on his person. He is also able to cast spells such as Fast Healing and Healing Hands. He can usually be found administering his duties and praying in the cathedral's main hall from morning to evening. As a secondary service, he serves as a vendor for goods such as books, scrolls, and soul gems.\r\nNeremus and a Thalmor Justiciar named Armion sometimes argue on the steps of the Cathedral, about whether the worship of Saint Martin contravenes the White-Gold Concordat. Here is an example of a potential conversation between Neremus and Armion:\r\nNeremus: \"If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. The Chapel of St. Martin does not violate the terms of the White-Gold Concordat. There is no Talos worship going on here.\"\r\nArmion: \"It violates the spirit of the White-Gold Concordat. I must urge you to cease and desist at once.\"\r\nNeremus: \"Oh? What is the spirit of the White-Gold Concordat?\"\r\nArmion: \"The spirit of the White-Gold Concordat is that men are not, and can never be, gods. Just as Tiber Septim is not a god, nor is Martin Septim.\"\r\nNeremus: \"But what does the Concordat actually say?\"\r\nArmion: \"The Concordat forbids Talos worship.\"\r\nNeremus: \"No mention of Martin Septim worship, though?\"\r\nArmion: \"I... no, there isn't. I must consult with my superiors. Perhaps we will have to petition for a slight amendment to some... unfortunately specific wording within the Concordat. We will keep our eyes on your little cult, however.\"\r\nHere is an example of a potential conversation between Neremus and Harthir: \r\nNeremus: \"Oh, there you are.\"\r\nHarthir: \"Priest Neremus! I'm sorry, I didn't know you were looking for me.\"\r\nNeremus: \"That's alright, initiate. I just wanted to ask - how are you faring with your duties?\"\r\nHarthir: \"Well, for today, I tidied up the undercroft, prepared the shrines for Sundas service, scrubbed the floors...\"\r\nNeremus: \"Indeed? That's remarkable. I don't even remember asking you the last one.\"\r\nHarthir: \"I aim to please, Priest Neremus. Both you and Saint Martin.\"\r\nNeremus: \"Well, you certainly are the most devoted acolyte I've ever seen. I'm sure Saint Martin appreciates your service as much as I. Carry on.\"\r\nHere are some examples of Harthir's potential dialogue towards visitors and travelers:\r\n\"Greetings, stranger. Have you come to learn the gospel of St. Martin?\"\r\n\"Ah, greetings, acolyte of Saint Martin. What brings you back to our humble chapel?\"\r\n\"Have you heard the tale of how Martin Septim ascended to sainthood? If not, perhaps that would be a good place to begin.\"\r\n\"Saint Martin had humble beginnings as a priest of Akatosh in the city of Kvatch. When Daedra overran the city during the Oblivion Crisis, Martin led the people to refuge in the chapel. The fabled Champion of Cyrodiil came to rescue Him, and told Him the shocking news that He was the son of the Emperor. This came as a surprise to Him, but gave Him new purpose after His home was destroyed. Along with the Champion and the Blades, Martin designed and executed a plan to undermine the efforts of Mankar Camoran and the Mythic Dawn cult.\"\r\n\"There was a great battle here in Bruma as the Great Gate was opened to secure an artifact of immense power for Martin's plan. Finally, the Champion, under Martin's guidance, slew Mankar Camoran, as the Imperial City came under a great Daedric siege. It appeared all was lost, but Martin shattered the Amulet of Kings in the Temple of the One, transforming into a huge, flaming Avatar of Akatosh. In this form He defeated the manifestation of Mehrunes Dagon in an epic, glorious duel. This broke the siege of the Imperial City, restored the ward between Tamriel and Oblivion, and ended the Oblivion Crisis.\"\r\nIf a visitor declines to hear Saint Martin's story: \"No problem. Thank you for your time, and take this book on the life of Saint Martin in case you change your mind.\"",
