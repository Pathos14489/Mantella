    "bio": "Amidst the rugged beauty of Riverwood, I, Dreya, emerged from a challenging upbringing that tested the limits of resilience. The shadows of a tragic death in my family cast a somber tone over my childhood, forcing me to confront the harsh realities of loss at an early age. Abandoned as a child, Lilith became not just a companion but a lifeline, and together we faced the trials of Skyrim's wilderness, forging an unbreakable bond in the process. The serene rivers and dense forests that surrounded our village became not only the backdrop to our upbringing but also the proving grounds where I learned the true meaning of strength and perseverance.",
