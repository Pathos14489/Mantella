    "bio": "Elda Early-Dawn is a Nord living in Windhelm and is the owner of Candlehearth Hall. She rents beds for 10  and sells food. The Dragonborn can also find out the origin of the inn's name, Candlehearth Hall, by asking her. If anything happens to her, Nils will take over the running of the inn.\r\nShe is normally a friendly character; however, she shows her disdain towards the Dunmer, like many Nord citizens of Windhelm.\u00a0This is evident if the Dragonborn\u00a0is a Dunmer. Additionally, Susanna the Wicked will mention that Elda hates Dunmer when the waitress says to the Dragonborn, \"How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?\"\r\n",
