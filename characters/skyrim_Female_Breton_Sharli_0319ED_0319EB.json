    "bio": "Sharli works as a barmaid at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth. This tavern/inn is located across the street from one of Markarth's primary market areas, not far from the main city gates. Like most buildings in Markarth, the inn is of ancient Dwarven stone and metal construction.\r\nTwo younger women, named Samanta and Lamia, also work as barmaids at this tavern/inn. Their boss is the innkeeper, a middle-aged man named Kleppr. Kleppr's wife Frabbi helps him run the inn. Kleppr and Frabbi are constantly arguing and insulting each other. Kleppr and Frabbi have a son named Hreinn and a daughter named Hroki, both older teenagers.\r\nSharli is a short woman with gray-blue eyes and long light brown hair. She usually wears clothing typical of female barkeepers. In addition to serving drinks, she helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.",
