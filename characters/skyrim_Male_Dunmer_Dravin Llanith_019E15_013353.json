    "bio": "Dravin Llanith is a Dunmer farmer who lives with his wife Synda at the Merryfair Farm, less than an hour\u2019s walk from the city of Riften.\r\nThey make a living growing wheat, cabbage, and gourds. They also have a cow and chickens. Dravin can often be seen milling wheat.\r\nThere was a recent break-in at their farm. Among the loot that was pilfered was Dravin's Bow. He believes the Thieves Guild was behind the burglary and that they stashed his bow somewhere in the Ratways beneath Riften.\r\nIf the player returns Dravin's bow to him, he will be grateful and consider the player a friend.\r\nDravin worries about his wife\u2019s safety when she walks to Riften, and urges her to always bring her dagger when she travels so she can defend herself from wolves or bandits.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"It's not safe around here. There's thieves out there looking to steal everything you own.\"\r\n\"Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.\"\r\n\"Dragons, thieves and war. I should have stayed in Morrowind.\"\r\n\"A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole my bow! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had. If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can.\"\r\n\u201cWe're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us. We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for. Not only did they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people.\"\r\nIf the player returns his bow to him: \"That's it! You found it! I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again. Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough.\"\r\n\"Azura's wisdom to you, friend.\"",
