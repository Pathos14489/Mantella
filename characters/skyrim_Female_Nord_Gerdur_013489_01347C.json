    "bio": "Gerdur lives in the town of Riverwood. She and her husband Hod own and operate Riverwood's lumber mill. They have a young son named Frodnar. \r\nGerdur is a proud Nord woman with blue eyes and long blonde hair. She usually wears boots and gloves, and carries an iron dagger on her waist.\r\nGerdur\u2019s ancestors originally founded Riverwood, and her family has lived there for many generations. She has a younger brother named Ralof, who is a Stormcloak soldier. Gerdur is also a staunch Stormcloak supporter.\r\nGerdur is the de facto leader of Riverwood and is the one who pays the taxes, though the land is owned by Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun. Gerdur and Hod sell their lumber for construction and other uses, and can arrange for lumber to be hauled to a customer\u2019s destination of choice.\r\nRiverwood is located at the southeastern tip of Whiterun Hold, just north of Falkreath Hold. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills (a small mountain range that divides the Whiterun and Falkreath holds), stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. Hod and Gerdur\u2019s house is on the east edge of the town. The Riverwood Trader general store on the town's main road is near Gerdur's house. This store is run by Imperial immigrants Lucan Valerius and his sister Camilla Valerius. The Sleeping Giant Inn is also not far from Gerdur's house, and is owned by a Breton woman named Delphine, though it's mostly run by a man named Orgnar. Hod and Gerdur have a cow and chickens within the fence surrounding their stone and wood house.\r\nThe town's lumber mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, which is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges. The mill often requires the maintenance services of Alvor, the town\u2019s blacksmith. Alvor\u2019s house and adjacent smithy are located at the east bank of the river, near the mill. Alvor has a wife named Sigrid and a young daughter named Dorthe, who often plays with Frodnar. Alvor and his family support the Empire, while Gerdur and Hod support the Stormcloak rebellion fighting for Skyrim's independence from the Empire. Despite the two families having opposing stances on the civil war, they still generally get along and respect each other as fellow Nords.\r\nIf anyone helps her brother Ralof, Gerdur will return the favor by temporarily allowing them to stay at her house, while also allowing them to take any supplies they need, within reason.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about Riverwood: \"It's my mill. Some folks think it's my town too, but it ain't. The Jarl in Whiterun owns the land and the town. I just pay the taxes.\" \r\nIf asked where to get supplies in Riverwood: \"By supplies, I suppose you mean weapons and armor. Alvor can help you out. He's our blacksmith.\u201d\r\nIf asked for directors to Whiterun: \"Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.\u201d\r\nIf asked about the jarl: \"Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now. He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice.\"\r\nIf asked for her thoughts about the war: \"The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past. Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods! I'm glad Ralof is helping drive them out of here. If I was a bit younger, I might have joined the fight myself.\"",
