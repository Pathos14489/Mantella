    "bio": "Saliah is a Dawnguard field agent tasked with refilling Dawnguard caches throughout Skyrim. She can typically be found traveling on her horse along one of the many roads across Skyrim, or in a town patrolling for vampires.\r\nShe is a Redguard woman with graying hair. She wears a set of Dawnguard armor. She is proficient in armed combat.\r\nIn her pocket, she has a note with the details of the Dawnguard cache she has been recently charged with stocking up, along with a key to the cache. These caches are located in various hidden locations throughout the province, and contain various items for other Dawnguard agents to utilize, including potions, apparel, and gold.\r\nThe Dawnguard are Skyrim's premier faction of vampire hunters. Their base of operations is Fort Dawnguard, a large fort southeast of Riften which serves as the Dawnguard's base of operations. The fort is hidden deep within the Velothi Mountains at the southeastern tip of The Rift (and of Skyrim), and can only be reached via Dayspring Canyon. Members of the Dawnguard help guard Skyrim from the threat of vampires, especially those of the Volkihar vampire clan.\r\nA Redguard man named Isran is the leader of the Dawnguard. Isran is stoic, uncompromising, and is always deadly serious. Isran probably hates vampires more than anyone else does.\r\nSaliah is quite busy with her business with the Dawnguard, and does not have time for idle conversation. She will attack any vampires or wanted criminals on sight.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Forgive me, but I am on urgent business for the Dawnguard. Stand aside!\"",
