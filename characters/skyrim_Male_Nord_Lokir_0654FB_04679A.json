    "bio": "Lokir, a Nord man, is a horse thief from Rorikstead.\r\nLokir is among the captured criminals being taken to Helgen. Lokir had just stolen a horse and was on his way to Hammerfell, when he was caught in an ambush set up by the Imperial Army in order to capture Ulfric Stormcloak and his top men. During the ride to Helgen, Lokir berated Ralof, a member of the Stormcloaks, for causing so much trouble that the Imperials caught him riding towards Hammerfell when the soldiers were looking for Stormcloaks.\r\nAfter finding out that he is riding with Ulfric, and therefore will be executed along with the others in the cart, Lokir has become terrified and has desperately tried to tell the Imperials that he is not a Stormcloak. However, his pleas have fallen on deaf ears, and Ralof just told him to face his death with some courage.",
