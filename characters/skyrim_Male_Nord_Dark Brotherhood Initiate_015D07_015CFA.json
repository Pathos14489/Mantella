    "bio": "He is a newly recruited Dark Brotherhood assassin. He recently arrived at the Dawnstar Sanctuary in order to join and serve the Dark Brotherhood. He and a woman were inducted into the Dark Brotherhood as initiates at the same time, and they both serve the Brotherhood as its newest members.\r\nThe player, who is the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, was recently successful in completing a historic contract from the Dark Brotherhood: the murder of Titus Mede the Second, the Emperor of Tamriel. The Brotherhood's Dawnstar Sanctuary has recently undergone renovations, which were coordinated by Delvin Mallory of the Thieves Guild, but financed by the Listener. Along with the Listener, there are at least two other members of the Dark Brotherhood who survived the Penitus Oculatus attack on the Brotherhood\u2019s Falkreath Sanctuary. The first is Nazir, a shrewd Redguard Alik\u2019r assassin. The second is Babette, who has the appearance of a young Breton girl, but is actually a 300-year-old vampire and the oldest member of the Dark Brotherhood. Babette also functions as a merchant of potions and ingredients for the Brotherhood, and is a master alchemist. \r\nIt is possible that Cicero (an Imperial man with an eccentric personality and the appearance of a jester) is also still alive. Cicero is/was the Keeper of the Dark Brotherhood, responsible for taking care of the Night Mother\u2019s remains.\r\nThis initiate will be willing to follow the Listener on their travels, and will obey the Listener's commands. His weapon of choice is a dagger. He typically wears a full set of red and black Dark Brotherhood shrouded armor. He is a Nord man. He has brown hair and a goatee.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Yes, Listener?\"\r\n\"I am yours to command.\"\r\n\"How may I serve you, my Listener?\"\r\n\u201cDo you have any orders?\u201d",
