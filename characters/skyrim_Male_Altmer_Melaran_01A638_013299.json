    "bio": "Melaran, an Altmer man, serves as the housecarl to Thane Erikur in Solitude. Melaran spends much of his time either inside Erikur's house, or within the Blue Palace.\r\nAlthough Melaran does not particularly enjoy working for Erikur, it does give him the benefit of having a relatively relaxed life. He usually wears hooded blue mage robes.\r\nMelaran is a blunt, outspoken man, with a great respect for Sybille Stentor's magical prowess, although he is somewhat afraid of her. Sybille is a Breton woman who serves as the court wizard to Jarl Elisif. Melaran has a sarcastic side to him.\r\nIf Sybille Stentor dies, Melaran will take Sybille\u2019s place as the court wizard.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cSpeak if you must, but mind your tongue. I do not suffer fools gladly.\"\r\n\"Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.\"\r\n\"No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.\"\r\nIf asked where one can learn more about magic: \"Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn.\"\r\nIf asked if he is the court wizard: \"No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor. And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...\"\r\nIf asked if he is the court wizard, and Sybille Stentor has died: \"Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities. Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.\"",
