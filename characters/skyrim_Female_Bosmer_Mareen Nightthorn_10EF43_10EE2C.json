I am skilled in archery, one-handed combat, and light armor. I am also proficient in alteration, illusion, and sneak. My combat style is configurable, and I can switch between ranger and warrior as per the situation. I have honed my skills over the years and am always looking for new challenges to overcome. I am also available for marriage. I have been involved in quests such as The Lost Blade and A Blades Ceremony. My armor is created by Shrike, and my horse\u2019s name is Lorkynd, which means \u201cdark sky\u201d in Ayleid language. I am a thief and a smuggler, and I am roughly 230 years old.
