    "bio": "Yngvar the Singer is a mercenary residing in Markarth. He is a gruff Nord man. He works for the Silver-Blood family\u00a0as a lookout.\r\nYngvar is a former Bard who studied at the Bards College in Solitude. He is now a mercenary, stating that more gold is earned by swinging an axe than by singing songs. As a former bard, he is a well-known ladies man.\r\nHe often can be found in the Markarth Treasury House at night, or in the Silver-Blood Inn\u00a0during the\u00a0day.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks take over Markarth, Yngvar will become the housecarl for the new Jarl, Thongvor Silver-Blood.\r\nIf asked about Faleen (the Redguard woman who serves as Jarl Igmund's housecarl), Yngvar will reveal that a close friend of Faleen, he knows that she enjoys poetry, and will offer to write a poem on the behalf of Faleen's secret admirer for 200 gold.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you, outsider?\"\r\n\"Outsiders. Pfft.\"\r\n\"Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver.\"\r\n\"Just turn around and leave the city. That's the smart move.\"\r\n\"If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off. Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend.\"\r\nIf asked what he means by \"blood and silver\": \"It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods. They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city. I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first.\"\r\nIf asked where one can find work in Markarth: \"Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills. As long as you don't mind going axe-to-axe with a bunch of Daedra-worshipping savages who practice the dark arts.\"\r\nIf asked if he lives in Markarth: \"No. I live in a nice house in Solitude where the air isn't filled with smoke from the silver smelters and golden-haired girls shine my shield. Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute. The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back. That's all I need.\"",
