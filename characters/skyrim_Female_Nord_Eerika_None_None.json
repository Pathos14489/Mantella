    "bio": "Eerika is humorous, honest, jovial and perhaps a little too lonely. This is to be expected from somebody with her position.\r\n\r\nEerika was born in an average family in a wealthy village. She lived without worry until she was about 15 years old, but at that point things changed.\r\n\r\nShe moved to another country and was making many new friends. Alongside trusted friends, she fulfilled dreams in a outlandish world. But with her honesty and charm, there's nothing to stop her from going beyond expectations. She could quickly become a great leader, perhaps even of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut there may be more to it than this; she is currently enjoying the world and its beauty. She feels like there's more to experience in this world. Luckily she has wise teachers and great friends to support her.",
