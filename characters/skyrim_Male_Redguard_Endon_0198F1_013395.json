    "bio": "Endon, a Redguard man, is a silversmith who lives with his family in\u00a0Markarth. \r\nHe wanders around Markarth with his daughter Adara during much of the daytime, and regularly visits the jewelry stall of his wife Kerah over at the market square. Endon and Kerah also have a young adult son named Cade, who is currently fighting as a Stormcloak in the Skyrim civil war. In the evening, he and his family will spend time in the Silver-Blood Inn with several of Markarth's other citizens. He is neighbors with an old Nord man named Ogmund, who sometimes performs as a skald at the Silver-Blood Inn.\r\nEndon will also be willing to serve a fence for the player, if the player retrives his lost silver candlestick mold. Endon does not have the funds to spend 4000 gold per day on stolen goods the player may try to sell to him.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf the player retrieves his silver candlestick mold: \"You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward. Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it. If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do.\"",
