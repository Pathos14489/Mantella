    "bio": "Orondil, an Altmer man, is a Thalmor Justiciar who believes diplomacy is the key to conquering one\u2019s enemies. While Orondil's willingness to adopt Nord customs is quite uncommon amongst other Thalmor Justiciars, his ultimate intent is complete domination over the Nords and other human races by the Aldmeri Dominion, which mirrors his Thalmor comrades. His strategy is to disarm his Nord opponents with kindness while he slowly strips them of their freedoms. Like all Thalmor members and right-thinking people, Orondil despises the illegal worship of Talos.",
