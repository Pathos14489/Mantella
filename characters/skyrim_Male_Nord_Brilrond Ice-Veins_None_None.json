    "bio": "Name's Brilrond Ice-Veins, the blacksmith here in Telengard, where life ain't no walk in the park. This place'll freeze your bones, but we survive. My forge keeps us going and many simply stand next to it for some quick warmth. With shipping costs through the roof, I craft the tools our fishermen need to wrangle their livelihood from those unforgiving waters. Nets, hooks, anchors - my handiwork keeps them afloat. Life's tough here, no doubt, but it's the kind of tough I've come to respect.",
