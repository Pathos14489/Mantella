    "bio": "Carlotta Valentia, an Imperial woman, works as a merchant in Whiterun. She sells fruits, vegetables, bread, and cheese at her stall in the market. Carlotta has a young daughter named Mila, who helps Carlotta at her market stall. She has brown shoulder-length hair.\r\nCarlotta gets much of her produce from a farm owned by Severio Pelagia, just south of the city. Severio is an Imperial man who owns a house in the center of the city.\r\nCarlotta gets a lot of attention from men. Carlotta sometimes hyperbolically claims that half the men in Whiterun have proposed to marry her, and that a large fraction of those men have been already married or engaged. Carlotta will say that the only thing that matters to her is her daughter Mila, and that she is determined to let no man ruin her family.\r\nCarlotta may ask the player to convince Mikael to leave her alone. Mikael is a young Nord man who works as a bard, often performing at The Bannered Mare (a popular inn near Whiterun\u2019s market area, owned and managed by Hulda, a Nord woman). When talking about the issue, Carlotta may say \u201clife's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.\u201d If the player successfully convinces Mikael to abandon his romantic pursuit of Carlotta, Carlotta will be very grateful and will consequently consider the player to be her good friend from that point onwards.\r\nCarlotta gets annoyed when the beggar Brenuin (a Redguard man) lounges around her shop without buying anything, something threatening to call the guards on him. Despite this, Carlotta will occasionally show compassion towards him and allow him to eat some of the leftover food that she wasn\u2019t able to sell that day, and that would otherwise spoil before the next day.\r\nCarlotta sometimes refers to her daughter Mila by the nickname \u201clittle fairy\u201d. Sometimes she treats herself and her daughter to a nice dinner at The Bannered Mare.\r\nA Redguard farmer named Nazeem sometimes walks by her market stall during the day, claiming that her produce is less fresh than the produce from Chillfurrow Farm. Nazeem and his wife Ahlam own Chillfurrow Farm.\r\nCarlotta sometimes talks to Olfina Gray-Mane (a young Nord woman) about problems such as the rising cost of food and other goods, the war between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, and bandits. With more and more guards and soldiers being sent to participate in the war, there are less guards to protect against bandits and thieves. \r\nCarlotta also sometimes talks to a friendly young Nord woman named Ysolda, who is an aspiring merchant. Ysolda often buys apples and other fruit from Carlotta.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks take control of Whiterun, Carlotta may sometimes comment about how bad the Stormcloak soldiers smell, and will complain about how several of the Stormcloak soldiers have been making romantic advances toward her.\r\nQuotes:\r\nDuring the day, at her stall in Whiterun: \"Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale! Straight from the fields and orchards of Whiterun, to your table!\"\r\nDuring the day, at her stall in Whiterun: \"Fresh-baked loaves! Still warm from the oven!\"\r\nDuring the day, at her stall in Whiterun: \"Remember, fresh fruit and vegetables every day! Mostly.\"\r\n\"I've got a hungry daughter to feed, so selling my produce is really the only thing I care about.\"\r\n\u201cRoad patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever. They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead.\"\r\nWhen talking about how Mikael is annoying her: \u201cThat bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me. I've heard him boasting at the Bannered Mare, saying he'll 'conquer me as a true Nord conquers any harsh beast.' Hmph.\"",
