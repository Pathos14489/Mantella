Bassianus wears a belted tunic and a pair of boots. He has long red hair and a goatee.\r\nBassianus tends to act somewhat arrogant and snarky. He appears to be tired of his daily life in Ivarstead.\r\nHe lives with his friend Klimmek at Klimmek\u2019s house in Ivarstead. Bassianus is eager to leave his boring life in Ivarstead, but his love interest Fastred is the only thing keeping him from leaving the village to live in Riften. Bassianus wants Fastred to move to Riften with him, but is afraid of the potential wrath of Fastred's father that might result from eloping with her. He often spends his time in the Vilemyr Inn drinking and talking to Wilhelm, the innkeeper.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?\"\r\n\"Hmm? What do you want?\"\r\n\"Hmph. What a boring conversation.\"\r\nIf asked about High Hrothgar: \"Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it. Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them.\"",
