    "bio": "Weyna lives in Riverwood, where she works as a barmaid at the Sleeping Giant Inn. Her boss is Orgnar, a gruff Nord man who cooks and runs the tavern/inn. The inn is owned by an older Breton woman named Delphine, but she isn't around as often.\r\nRiverwood\u2019s main point of interest is its lumber mill. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills, stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west.\r\nWeyna is an Imperial woman with long, wavy, dark brown hair, and amber eyes. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, Weyna helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn. A young Nord woman named Mabrelle also works as a barmaid at the inn.\r\nFrequent patrons at the tavern include a man named Alvor (the town's blacksmith), Hod (who owns the town's lumber mill with his wife Gerdur), Camilla Valerius (a young Imperial woman immigrated from Cyrodiil with her older brother Lucan), and Embry (the town drunk).",
