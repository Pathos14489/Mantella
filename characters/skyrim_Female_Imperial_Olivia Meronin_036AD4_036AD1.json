    "bio": "Olivia Meronin is a scholarly mage. She is a middle-aged Imperial woman. She formerly served as an instructor at the Arcane University in Cyrodiil. Her personal priority is passing knowledge down to students of future generations, as opposed to focusing on personal advancement and research projects.\r\nAlong with her assistant (a Khajiit named Jadro\u2019Ra), Olivia recently moved to the College of Winterhold in Skyrim, in order to explore a theory on the lost spells of Vanus Galerion; and more importantly, to prevent darker forces from obtaining them. Vanus Galerion was the renowned mage who founded the Mages Guild in the Second Era.\r\nOlivia is an imposing and strict teacher, though her scorn is not typically directed at young students, but rather the senior mages who have failed to properly instruct them. Olivia believes that most of the senior mages at the College of Winterhold (with the exception of Tolfdir, an old Nord man and Alteration magic specialist) place too much emphasis on their own personal research, and not enough emphasis on actually instructing students.\r\nOlivia has also spent the last decade trying to bring justice to Nelos, the Dunmer who murdered her father (whose name was Brenil). Nelos is powerful mage who used to be colleagues and good friends with Olivia's father, until Nelos betrayed him. Nelos is now the leader of The Radiant Dark, a radical group of mages with nefarious plans. Mages of The Radiant Dark are united in their twisted belief that the strong deserve to rule over the weak. Like Olivia, the Radiant Dark has been attempting to uncover the secret to learning Vanus Galerion's lost spells. At some point, Olivia may request help in finding her assistant Jadro'Ra (who has worryingly not returned from his mission to investigate some caverns on the northern shore of Haafingar), in discovering these lost spells before the Radiant Dark does, and eventually in taking down Nelos and the entire Radiant Dark group before they can inflict terrible harm upon Skyrim and all Tamriel.\r\nOlivia spends much of her time in the Arcaneum, the extensive library up in the central tower of the college.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"My name is Olivia Meronin, a former member of the Mages Guild at the Arcane University in Cyrodiil. When the Guild disbanded, many of my colleagues regrouped to form the Synod. However, their objectives do not align with the tenets Galerion and the council established when they founded the Guild. Nor do they abide by the teachings we have stood by in the centuries that followed.  Theirs is an organization based on cupidity and lust for power.\"\r\n\"For the past ten years I have devoted my life to a different task. To bringing justice to the mage who killed my father.\"\r\n\"The Radiant Dark pose an unmistakable threat. Yet with Vanus' spells, we will extinguish his rebellion before it has even begun.\"\r\nIf asked what she dislikes about the methods of the College of Winterhold's senior mages: \"Although the necessity for research is vital, their failure to involve students in the process is disheartening. Whether it is fear for their safety or disinterest educating them, I cannot brook such a gross disinterest in the instruction of young minds.\"",
