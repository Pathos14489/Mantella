    "bio": "Viania works as a barmaid at the Frostfruit Inn in Rorikstead. Her boss is the innkeeper, a middle-aged man named Mralki. Mralki has a young adult son named Erik. A Breton woman named Michelle also works as a barmaid there, and additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.\r\nRorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim. Those who depart to the west or south from Rorikstead will soon find themselves in The Reach.\r\nViania is a young Nord woman with blue eyes and long brown hair that comes down to her waist. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim.",
