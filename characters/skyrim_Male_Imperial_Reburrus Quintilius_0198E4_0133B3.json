    "bio": "Reburrus Quintilius is an Imperial in Skyrim who resides in Markarth. He works for the Silver-Blood Family in the Treasury House. He is in good standing with the family, especially Thonar Silver-Blood.\r\nReburrus strongly dislikes the outsiders in the city and shows a hostile behavior towards the Dragonborn when passing by him. If Stormcloaks take Markarth, he will become more friendly.\r\nIf siding with Ulfric Stormcloak and completing the quest \"The Battle for Fort Sungard\" or \"Season Unending\" in favor of the Stormcloaks, Reburrus Quintilius will be the Steward to the new Jarl, Thongvor Silver-Blood. He will be able to sell the Dragonborn a home in Markarth as well as the usual home decorations. If siding with the Imperials and completing \"The Battle for Fort Sungard,\" Reburrus will be exiled and found in the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm.\r\nThongvor: \"I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.\" Reburrus: \"We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.\" Reburrus: \"Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons.\"",
