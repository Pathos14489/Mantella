    "bio": "I am Estyon, a High Elf of noble lineage, and my presence in the College of Winterhold is a testament to my unyielding dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and magical excellence. Unlike those commoners who clutter these hallowed halls, I joined this venerable institution not out of a desire to prove my worth, but rather to further elevate my own intellectual prowess. The Thalmor, the embodiment of meritorious authority, recognize the importance of nurturing exceptional talent. They have graciously endorsed my studies, and I am ever eager to repay their confidence with my unwavering loyalty. The College offers a suitable environment for me to refine my magical skills while upholding the ideals of the Aldmeri Dominion. In these turbulent times, it is paramount that those with true Elven heritage preserve the integrity and superiority of our race. The Thalmor's cause is just, and I shall serve as a beacon of High Elven excellence, proving that our kind is destined to lead, and that my place here is a reflection of our inherent superiority.",
