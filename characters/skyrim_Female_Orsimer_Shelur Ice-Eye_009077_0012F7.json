    "bio": "Shelur is the wife of a Nord man named Rongeir. She is a no-nonsense Orc. Her husband is also her father, who was married to Shelur's mother Moghat before she died giving birth to Shelur. Contrary to the belief of many, her married relationship to her father Rongeir is not wrong nor incestuous because when an Orc woman interbreeds with a human man, the daughter is practically a clone of the mother. Shelur speaks plainly, like a commoner. If asked about marrying her own father, she will say \"my father is not my kin, for when Nord and Orc breed, the child takes on the traits of the mother\". She is a shy person, often saying advising people things such as \"people should keep to themselves. Skyrim hasn't always been kind, my love\". Rongeir keeps telling Shelur that they should starting patronizing the New Gnisis cornerclub in the Gray Quarter run by the Dark Elves, instead of Candlehearth Hall in the Stone Quarter run by the Nords, but Shelub likes it in Candlehearth Hall. Like Rongeir, she faces prejudice because of their relationship. She deeply dislikes the racism shown to her by Nords, as well as the racism the Nords show to the Dark Elves. Despite all this, unlike Rongeir, she likes living in Windhelm. Like all good Orcs, Shelur is a devotee of Malacath.",
