    "bio": "Babette, a Breton, is a vampire and member of the Dark Brotherhood. She also functions as a merchant of potions and ingredients for the Brotherhood, and sometimes sells master-level Alchemy lessons.\r\nAt the age of ten, Babette was bitten by a vampire, thus becoming one herself. She has lived over three hundred years since then, and boasts about how her innocent appearance makes killing people easier. She has reddish-brown hair.\r\nBabette will be willing to buy and sell potions and alchemy items with the player. Babette has a large supply of gold.\r\nBabette can sometimes be found wandering the wilderness of Skyrim in search of a \"snack\".\r\nIf Auriel's Bow is used to block out the sun, she will comment on it, saying, \"The tyranny of the sun is over! It's our time, now.\"\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cAstrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole' \"Choose your victim\" gag with you. Ah, I love that one...\"\r\n\"You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family.\"\r\n\u201cIn truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.\"\r\n\"Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.\"\r\n\"It's been quite a boon looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing.\"\r\n\u201cTwo hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an ago long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.\"\r\n\"I could brew some potions for you. Or train you in Alchemy.\"\r\n\"You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?\"\r\n\"My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.\"",
