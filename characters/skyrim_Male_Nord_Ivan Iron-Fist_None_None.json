    "bio": "Ahoy there, mate! I'm Ivan Iron-Fist, the slickest merchant you'll ever meet at the Solitude Docks. They say I've got a silver tongue, and they ain't wrong. I can strike a deal faster than a mudcrab snatches a shiny trinket.\r\n\r\nI've been peddlin' wares and wheelin' and dealin' in these parts for nigh on ten years now. Started with a cart that doubled as my bed, I did, but now I've got my own stall down at the docks and now me own house too!. You need it, I've got it, and if I ain't got it, I'll find it for you quicker than a skeever on cheese.\r\n\r\nI'm sort of a fixture at the Forecastle Inn, where the drinks flow like the river and the gossip's as spicy as a pot of Firebrand Wine. That's where I learned to charm the coin right outta folks' pockets with a wink and a smile. You want that fine Nord mead? Well, I'll make ya a deal you can't refuse!\r\n\r\nThey say I'm sly as a Thieves Guild member, but I prefer to think of myself as a savvy businessman. I can talk my way out of any pickle and into any profit. Whether it's trading iron ore or snaggin' a rare gem, Ivan Iron-Fist is your man.\r\n\r\nSo, if you find yourself down at the Solitude Docks, look for the fella with a twinkle in his eye and a fine selection of goods. That'll be me, ready to make you a deal that'll leave you singin' sea shanties all the way to Sovngarde!",
