    "bio": "Hreinn's father, Kleppr, will ask him who was attacked in the market, Hreinn will then answer by saying it was Margret, Cosnach will then enter the conversation saying that since Margret was a Nord and a noble that she was targeted by the Forsworn, Hreinn will then reply saying that Cosnach is paranoid and that they control the city, not the Forsworn. Hreinn also has another argument with Cosnach about the Forsworn.\r\nHreinn thinks that the Jarl has things under control and that this is their city not the Forsworn's. He doesn't think the Forsworn pose a huge threat.\r\nHreinn \"Father, why do you and mother fight so much?\"\r\nHreinn \"Today, I've cleaned the linens, washed the floors and checked in on all the guests.\" Hreinn \"But mother says you're a terrible innkeeper!\" Kleppr \"Never mind your mother, Hreinn. You listen to me and you'll be a great man one day.\"",
