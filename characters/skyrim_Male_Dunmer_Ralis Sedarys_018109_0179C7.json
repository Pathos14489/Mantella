    "bio": "Ralis Sedarys is a Dunmer treasure hunter and potential follower in The Elder Scrolls V: Dragonborn who can be found outside Kolbjorn Barrow searching for the relics of Ahzidal.\r\nHe can be found outside the barrow, and needs funding for the excavation, with the exact sum being 1000 . After some time, a courier will deliver a letter asking for your assistance once more. Throughout the mission, he will ask for more gold, in order to hire more miners initially and, subsequently, mercenaries. The second time he requests 2000 , the third 3000, and finally the fourth 5000 . Therefore, this translates to 11000  total before he is finally done with the work needed to complete the mission.\r\nSpeaking to Ralis will initiate this quest. He is essential to the quest, and can be killed or spared at the end of the aforementioned quest.\r\nIf he survives the events of Unearthed, he will move to The Retching Netch in Raven Rock, and can be recruited as a follower. He can be considered the most expensive follower in the game and the only one who calls the Dragonborn \"boss.\"\r\nRalis is highly proficient in ranged and melee combat, often choosing to dual-wield Hoarfrost with another pickaxe. He appears to have both perks in Dual Flurry, and combined with Extra Damage perk, he is likely to perform several consecutive power attacks when in melee. At range, he will use a standard bow and arrows, inflicting considerable damage.\r\nIf the player equips him with Ahzidal's Ring of Arcana, he will make use of \"Ignite\" and \"Freeze\" as ranged attacks.",
