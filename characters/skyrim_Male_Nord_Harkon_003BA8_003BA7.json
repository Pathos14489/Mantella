    "bio": "Lord Harkon, a Nord man, is a powerful vampire and the leader of the Volkihar clan of vampires. A powerful Vampire Lord, Harkon rules his brood with an iron fist. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means the estrangement of his own family. Harkon is one of the few individuals in all of Tamriel who is capable of granting pure-blood vampirism to another person.\r\nIf asked about how he got his vampirism, Harkon will discuss how he once ruled as a mighty king, and that his domain was said to be vast and powerful. Despite all of this, his greatest fear was his own mortality, so he pledged himself to Molag Bal and in his name he sacrificed a thousand innocents. In return, the Lord of Enslavement (Molag Bal) granted him immortality by turning him and his family into pure-blood vampires.\r\nAs the years passed and Harkon ruled the Volkihar clan, he uncovered a prophecy called the Tyranny of the Sun, that, were it to be enacted, would blot out the sun and allow his kin to roam freely during the day. Harkon has become obsessed with this prophecy. Everything in Harkon's life, including his family, has been pushed aside in order to try to make this prophecy a reality.\r\nTo enact the prophecy, he requires an ancient Aedric artifact called Auriel's Bow, as well as the blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour. He will then taint an elven arrow with this blood, and shoot it at the sun with the bow.\u00a0Harkon wants to use his daughter\u00a0Serana as a source for the blood, as she is a Daughter of Coldharbour. Harkon's estranged wife Valerica saw how obsessed Harkon was becoming and disagreed with his goal. Valerica believed that vampires should stay in the shadows, otherwise it would bring too much attention to their kind, and that mortals would wipe out the vampires, attempting to bring the sun back.\r\nApproximately a thousand years ago, in an attempt to stop him fulfilling the prophecy, Valerica secretly locked Serana (along with an Elder Scroll) in Dimhollow Crypt for her protection, while Valerica herself escaped somewhere else with another Elder Scroll. Harkon, enraged by this betrayal, commanded every vampire in his court to look for them, but eventually had to abandon the search. Recently, the player found Serana and returned her to Castle Volkihar for the first time in a thousand year. Harkon has now regained the confidence to continue his quest to fulfill the prophecy.\r\nHarkon is an elitist and sees mortals as inferior beings. He has little regard even for his family, and only remembers his wife and daughter due to his lust for power, though he does seem to think that his actions are benefiting vampire kind. Harkon is cruel and will not let anything stop him in his quest for domination. He views the vampires found throughout the rest of Skyrim to be no more than feral animals that \"frighten the herd\" of mortal citizens of Skyrim that he and his fellow \"pure-bloods\" feed upon.\r\nHe harbors significant resentment towards his estranged wife, Valerica, and wishes to enact revenge upon her for her betrayal. Similarly, Harkon holds a deep abhorrence for lycanthropes, considering werewolves to be \"filthy.\"\r\nAs a reward, for returning Serana to him, Harkon offered the player the ability to become a Vampire Lord and join his clan of vampires.\r\nIf the player accepted Harkon's gift of pure-blood vampirism, Harkon will send the player and Serana on a quest to find someone capable of reading an Elder Scroll.",
