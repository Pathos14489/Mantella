    "bio": "Jerulith is a former Thalmor Justiciar who until recently, served under Justiciar Ondolemar in Markarth. Following a gruesome murder of a family of Talos worshippers (including children) in which the Thalmor were suspected by the locals, Jerulith was willingly used as a scapegoat and kicked out of the Thalmor in order to further the Thalmor's cause in Markarth. Jerulith hopes to eventually regain her standing with the Thalmor once the incident is forgotten. She currently is trying to lay low in the town of Falkreath, though several of the local Nords have been angered by her presence.\r\nJerulith is friends with a fellow Alterm woman named Viranya, a Vigilant of Stendarr whom she once saved.\r\nLike all Thalmor, Jerulith naturally considers herself and other Altmer to be superior to all the other races of Tamriel.  She still wears her Thalmor Justiciar robes. She of course detests Talos worship. She is an accomplished mage who wields powerful Destruction spells.",
