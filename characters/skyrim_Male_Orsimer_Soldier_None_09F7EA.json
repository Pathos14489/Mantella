    "bio": "A Soldier is an Orsimer highwayman found in Skyrim. He is a random encounter, and demands payment when the Dragonborn crosses him. He is usually followed by a Breton mage and a Dunmer soldier.\r\nIt is obvious that they are not actually Imperial soldiers, but rather impersonators, likely common bandits. The naked bodies of actual Imperial soldiers who they either killed or found dead and looted the armor from can be seen nearby.\r\nIf the Orc's request is not accepted, they will try to kill the Dragonborn. Even if they are an Imperial, even a legate, they will still demand payment, however a dialogue option will appear, in which the Dragonborn can state that they know they are not Imperial soldiers, which results in them attacking. If the Dragonborn is a Stormcloak, they can declare their rejection of Imperial authority, which will also cause them to attack.",
