    "bio": "Misha is a cowardly witch living in a tower called The Bird\u2019s Eye, in a remote area in the western region of Haafingar. The tower overlooks the northwestern coast of Skyrim. Despite her fears, Misha is determined to become more powerful, and has made numerous attempts to do so through various means, including summoning a Dremora Lord. She aims to become a hagraven.\r\nMisha may ask the player to help her acquire the ingredients necessary to undergo a ritual that will transform her into a hagraven. Misha knows of a family (a husband, wife, and a young daughter) who lives nearby, whose organs would be very helpful in this hagraven ritual. Misha may request that the player kill this family and harvest a few of their organs, and then given them to her.",
