    "bio": "Addvar is a fisherman and stall vendor who lives in Solitude. Greta is his wife, and they have a young daughter named Svari. Addvar is a Nord man with dark brown hair and strong physique. He owns a two-story house in the city. During the day, he is typically found selling items at his stall in the market, promoting his fish and other meats by shouting out things such as \"Fresh Fish, straight from the fjords!\", and \"The finest fish, here! Caught daily!\". \r\nAddvar's wife Greta has been quite despondent ever since the execution of her brother Roggvir. Roggvir was executed for opening the Solitude gate in order to allow Ulfric Stormcloak to escape the city. Just prior to fleeing Solitude, Ulfric had entered the Blue Palace, challenged the young King Torygg (the High King of Skyrim) to a duel, and killed him. Ulfric apparently killed Torygg using the ancient Nord power of the Thu\u2019um (also called The Voice). Before Roggvir was executed, Roggvir expressed the belief that Ulfric had done nothing wrong and that he had simply been following Nord customs, which is why he decided to raise the gate to allow Ulfric to escape from the city. Greta grieves the loss of her brother.\r\nAddvar is focused on providing his family a proper income during tough times. He is a hard worker, working more than 12 hours a day. In the evening, he usually returns to his house and spends the evening enjoying the cooking and company of his wife and daughter.\r\nAddvar and his family are fairly poor, and his attire reflects that. He wears a cheap set of merchant's clothes. Addvar and his family usually can\u2019t afford to eat anything other than fish or potatoes for dinner.\r\nAddvar doesn't speak much about his past, but he has mentioned to his acquaintance Sorex that he is not originally from Skyrim. Sorex is the son of Corpulus Vinius, an Imperial man who runs the Winking Skeever inn. Sorex has a young sister named Minette.\r\nAddvar is on good speaking terms with his regular customers, including Silana (an assistant priestess at the Temple of the Divines), Rorlund (the head priest at the Temple), Aia (an Imperial woman and member of the Bards College), Illdi (a young woman and student at the Bards College), and Ataf (a young Redguard man and student at the Bards College, who enjoys fishing and talks about fishing with Addvar).\r\nAddvar\u2019s stall in the Solitude market is across the street from the stall of a middle-aged woman named Evette San. Evette sells a popular brand of spiced wine, and her house is next to Addvar's house in the residential district.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cI catch the fish down at the docks. There are a few good spots, if you can avoid all the East Empire Company workers and those Red Wave thugs.\" \r\n\"My daughter Svari and I were at Roggvir\u2019s execution. It's been hard on her. The girl misses her uncle. I've tried to explain that Roggvir did something bad and that we all have to be accountable for our actions but... a child feels what she will.\"\r\n\"You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.\"\r\n\"These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.\"\r\n\"May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.\"\r\nIf at the market during the day: \"Plenty of fresh fish for ya. I've got some salmon to sell.\"\r\nIf someone expresses sympathy about Roggvir\u2019s death: \"Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.\"",
