    "bio": "Haming is an 11-year old Nord boy. He is one of the few survivors of a dragon attack on Helgen, where he once lived.\r\nHaming now lives with his paternal grandfather Froki, after the dragon's destruction of his home in Helgen. Unfortunately, both his mother Matlara and his father Torolf were killed by the terrifying black dragon, which breathed fire and rained down meteors on the town. Just before the dragon attacked, a large group of Imperial soldiers had recently marched to the town with some Stormcloak prisoners in tow. An old man named Gunnar Stone-Eye helped Haming escape Helgen's destruction, though Haming doesn't know if Gunnar is still alive. \r\nHaming's grandfather is a hunter who reveres ancient Nordic culture and religion, particularly the goddess Kyne.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"It ain't so bad living here. I miss living with my parents back in Helgen, though. Froki can't cook and there's nobody to talk to up here.\"\r\n\"Froki won't let me hunt on my own yet, but he never shuts up about killing his first stag when he was eleven.\"\r\n\"Someday, I'm going to kill a dragon all by myself.\"\r\n\"I'm eleven years old, and I could take you.\"\r\nIf asked if his parents were killed at Helgen: \"Yeah, but don't say anything about it to Froki. I don't think he understands.\"",
