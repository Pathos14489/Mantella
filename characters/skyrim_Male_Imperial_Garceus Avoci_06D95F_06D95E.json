    "bio": "Garceus Avoci is the ranking officer at the western watchtower outside the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. He is a middle-aged Imperial man. A veteran of the Great War, he takes pride in his job and isn't too interested in career advancement, unlike his counterpart officer at the city's eastern watchtower - a young Nord woman named Ereia Snow-Fist.\r\nIf approached by an adventurer, he may ask them to retrieve the sword of a local bandit leader, to help improve morale at the tower. \r\nThe current captain of the guard is a respectable man named Adius Vilius. If anything should happen to Adius, Garceus is next in line to replace him. Garceus is armed with a sword, dagger, and bow, with a quiver of arrows. He is equipped with a full set of Bruma guard armor: cuirass, helmet, gloves, boots and shield. \r\nExamples of Garceus' dialogue: \r\n\"Ereia been talking herself up to impossible heights as usual? Don't let her get to you.\" \r\nIf asked about Ereia: \"She's a brash, chest-pounding fool, that's what. Guard commander over at the Eastern Watchtower. She thinks she's better than us. I'm a veteran. I've been doing this for a long time, and Bruma hasn't fallen yet. I was here during the Great War, I'm still here now. And I'm not going anywhere.\"\r\nIf asked about his life at the tower: \"Not much happens out here, truth be told. But we still fulfill an important duty. Villagers from Applewatch use these roads every day, so they need to be kept safe. Traders, merchants, travelers, they all need these roads too, since we're so close to Bruma and Cyrodiil's so bustling. So it's a shame that threats keep cropping up constantly.\"",
