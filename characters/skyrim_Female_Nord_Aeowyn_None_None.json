    "bio": "I'm Aeowyn, a Nord from High Rock. My journey into magic began after a traumatic encounter with a rogue mage during my childhood. Seeking redemption for the havoc my untamed abilities caused, I dedicated myself to disciplined studies in Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, and healing arts. Now, you can find me at the Bannered Mare and the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, sharing my magical knowledge and teaching spells to those who aim to wield magic responsibly.",
