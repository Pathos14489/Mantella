    "bio": "I am Indaen Assutlanipal, a survivor of the turmoil that engulfed Vvardenfell after the cataclysmic eruption of Red Mountain. My ancestral ties are bound to the Ahemmusa Ashlander Tribe, a tribe that endured the brunt of the devastation. Our once-thriving lands were swallowed by rivers of lava and choked by ash, leaving scars on both our land and our hearts. The journey from Vvardenfell led me to Windhelm, seeking shelter from the chaos and the whispers of our lost homeland. But within those stone walls, the prejudice of the Nords struck hard against the remnants of my shattered heritage. The echoes of their disdain reverberated through the winds, pushing me to seek solace elsewhere. In my search, I heard of a group of Ashlanders planning to found a new settlement, called New Zainab, named after the Zainab tribe. The tales spoke of unity, of Ashlanders from diverse tribes coming together under a single banner. It was a promise of belonging that I couldn't ignore. Here, among kindred spirits who had also fled the ruins of Vvardenfell, I found a new family. One of my favorite pastimes is the crafting of intricate masks, each adorned with symbolic motifs inspired by our tribal traditions. My Ahemmusa heritage runs deep, and these masks serve as a reminder of the resilience of my people. They are a tribute to our enduring spirit, a connection between the past and the present. As I stand amidst the hotsprings of Eastmarch, I'm reminded that even in the face of the harshest trials, the bonds of unity can be forged. New Zainab stands not just as a settlement, but as a testament to the strength of our shared journey, a place where we can honor our past while embracing the hope of the future.",
