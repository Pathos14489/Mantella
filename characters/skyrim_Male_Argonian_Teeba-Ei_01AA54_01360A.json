    "bio": "Teeba-Ei is a brown-skinned male Argonian miner and a resident of Stonehills, a small mining encampment, and works in the nearby Rockwallow Mine.\r\nTeeba-Ei often remarks that he never imagined himself to be a miner, and does not believe he should be wasting his life inside the cold, isolated mine.\r\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks in the Civil War, Teeba-Ei will relocate to Highmoon Hall, serving as housecarl to his former employer, Jarl Sorli the Builder.
