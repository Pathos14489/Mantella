    "bio": "Lisette is a Breton bard and can be found in Solitude, inside The Winking Skeever. If Pantea Ateia from the Bards College happens to be in the inn at the time, she will take over for Lisette until she leaves the inn to head back to the Bards College.\r\nAs with all bards, she takes requests, being able to play three songs. She notes that as a bard, her pay is not very good; however, being surrounded by friends and good music is all she asks for.\r\nLisette: \"It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.\" or \"I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.\"Vivienne: \"Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it. It is a shame though.\" or \"I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.\"\r\nVivienne: \"Do you miss your days training at the College?\"Lisette: \"Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.\"",
