    "bio": "Muiri is a Breton apothecary's assistant for Bothela at The Hag's Cure in Markarth.\r\nMuiri grew up in Windhelm with Clan Shatter-Shield. After Friga Shatter-Shield was killed, Muiri met Alain Dufont. Alain used Muiri's friendship with the clan in an attempt to steal the clan's valuables, including the family heriloom, the warhammer Aegisbane. Once his plan was discovered, the Shatter-Shields accused Muiri of being an accomplice in the crime and drove her from Windhelm to Markarth, where she now resides as an alchemist apprentice and assistant to Bothela at The Hag's Cure. She then planned to kill Alain and Nilsine Shatter-Shield for her revenge, but instead decided to contact the Dark Brotherhood. She had even made two bottles of a special poison for the occasion.\r\nMuiri asks the player to kill her former lover and friend in this quest. She rewards the player with Muiri's Ring if both Alain and Nilsine are killed, although only the former is necessary to continue the Dark Brotherhood questline.\r\nShe becomes a candidate for marriage if her contract is fully completed, meaning both the main target and the optional one are killed. She is only an apothecary if Bothela is killed prior to marriage; otherwise she becomes a general goods merchant.",
