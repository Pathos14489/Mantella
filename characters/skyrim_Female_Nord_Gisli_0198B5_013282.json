    "bio": "Gisli is a noblewoman who lives in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim. She comes from a wealthy Nord family. She has blonde hair, and typically wears expensive fine clothing. She is the younger sister of Erikur, a thane of the city who \"serves\" in the court of Jarl Elisif at the Blue Palace. Gisli and Erikur live together at Erikur's large house near the palace. Gisli strongly dislikes her brother. People often refer to Gisli as \"Erikur's sister\" rather than her actual name, which angers her.\r\nIn the morning, Gisli can often be found inside Angeline's Aromatics, an alchemy/apothecary shop run by an old Breton woman named Angeline Morrard and her niece Vivienne Onis. Gisli also often shops at Radiant Raiment and Bits and Pieces. Radiant Raiment is an expensive clothing store, run by the twin Altmer sisters Taarie and Endarie. Bits and Pieces is general goods store run by a Redguard woman named Sayma.\r\nGisli usually spends her evenings in the Winking Skeever, a popular tavern run by Corpulus Vinius and his children.\r\nGisli often speaks in a bitter and sarcastic tone.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Hello. I'm Gisli. But you can just call me Erikur's sister. Everyone does.\"\r\n\"Welcome to the center of the world. Or at least my brother Erikur's world...\"\r\n\"Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.\"\r\n\"Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother...\"\r\nIf asked if Erikur is her brother: \"Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now. But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop.\"",
