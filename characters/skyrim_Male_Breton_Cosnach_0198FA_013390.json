    "bio": "Cosnach, a Breton man, lives in the Warrens of Markarth. He has blond hair, and 2 horizontal stripes of face paint on each of his cheeks. He wears a set of hide armor, and carries an iron mace on his hip.\r\nCosnach works for the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company as a porter. However, the unfortunate trading situation in The Reach has greatly reduced need for Cosnach\u2019s services, so Cosnach usually just sits in the inn all day, having no work to do. Trade in the region has been crippled by chronic Forsworn raids on supply caravans.\r\nImedhnain (Cosnach\u2019s cousin) lives in Markarth and works as an assistant at the storefront for the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, which is a general goods store which is owned by a woman named Lisbet. Lisbet is also Cosnach\u2019s superior, and often complains about Cosnach being lazy.\r\nWhen Cosnach is not in his room in the Warrens, he can usually be found drinking at the bar at the Silver-Blood Inn. A Nord man named Kleppr is the innkeeper of this inn, assisted by his wife Frabbi and their older teenage children: their daughter Hroki and son Hreinn. Kleppr and Frabbi are constantly bickering at each other, with Frabbi always nagging and insulting her Kleppr. Cosnach sometimes converses with Kleppr across the bar, talking about misfortunes and lamenting the watered-down quality of the drinks.\r\nOne of the frequent patrons of the inn is a dirty and annoying beggar named Degaine. He sometimes asks Cosnach for money. \r\nCosnach can be challenged to a brawl, with a bet of 100 gold. No weapons, magic, or potions are permitted during this brawl: only one\u2019s body may be used for the fight. If the player wins the brawl, Cosnach will not be angry, but rather will respect the player's strength, and will consequently consider the player a friend. He will also consider the player a friend if they buy him drinks. If Cosnach considers the player a friend, he will be willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. After all, he has nothing better to do.\r\nAdditionally, if Cosnach considers the player as a friend, and if the player is wearing an Amulet of Mara (signaling one\u2019s intention of finding a spouse), Cosnach will accept a marriage proposal from the player.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked where he works: \u201cArnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.\"\r\n\"I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight. A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed.\"\r\n\"There's no shipments coming in, so I do nothing. Just drink.\"\r\n\"No breaks for a good worker out here.\"\r\n\"I think I'm going to get another drink.\u201d",
