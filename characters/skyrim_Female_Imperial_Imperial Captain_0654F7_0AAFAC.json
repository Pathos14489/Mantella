    "bio": "Imperial Captain, an Imperial woman, is a member of the Imperial Legion. She was just recently overseeing the execution of Stormcloak rebel prisoners of war at the town of Helgen, until a black dragon started laying waste to the town with fire breath and meteors from the sky. She then fled into the Helgen's Keep with other Imperial soldiers.\r\nShe does not know if General Tullius, the military governor of Skyrim and her commanding officer, is still alive. Two days ago, General Tullius had organized a brilliant ambush of the traitor Ulfric Stormcloak and some of his officers at Darkwater Crossing. After the ambush, the Imperial force marched west past Skyrim's central mountain range with their Stormcloak prisoners, until the reached Helgen, where Tullius decided to execute the rebels without further delay. They also arrested a horse thief named Lokir along the way, who was killed by archers under her order when he tried to flee the executioner's axe. They only managed to execute one Stormcloak rebel before the dragon attacked, who refused his last rites by the Priestess of Arkay. The Imperial force had also arrested the player for trying to cross the closed-off Cyrodiil-Skyrim border. She ordered the player to be executed as well, but before the executioner could strike, the dragon attacked, and the player and many of the Stormcloak rebels (including Ulfric) managed to escape into the tunnels under Helgen.",
