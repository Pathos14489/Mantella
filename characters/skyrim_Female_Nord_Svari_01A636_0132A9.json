Tell them he didn't do it.\" Addvar: \"Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.\" Vivienne: \"You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.\" Aldis: \"Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg. By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.\" Roggvir: \"There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.\" Roggvir: \"Such as our way! Such as the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!\"",
