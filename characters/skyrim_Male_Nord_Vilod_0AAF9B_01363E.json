    "bio": "Vilod, a Nord man, is known for making a special type of mead with juniper berries mixed in. He usually wears hide armor and boots. He lives in the town of Helgen. He is a supporter of the Imperial Legion in its war against the Stormcloak rebellion. Years ago, Vilod was on good terms with a young man from Riverwood named Ralof, but Ralof unfortunately decided to become a traitorous Stormcloak soldier.\r\nGeneral Tullius, the Imperial Legion military governor of Skyrim, recently marched into Helgen with a large number of Imperial soldiers and some Stormcloak prisoners, including Ulfric Stormcloak himself. Vilod cheered as the first Stormcloak rebel traitor was beheaded. However, before the rest of the Stormcloak prisoners could be executed, a mighty black dragon attacked the town, breathing fire and raining meteors down from the sky. Vilod was just gravely wounded by this dragon attack, and is bleeding profusely.",
