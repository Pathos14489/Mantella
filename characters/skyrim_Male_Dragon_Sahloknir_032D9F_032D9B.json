    "bio": "Sahloknir is a dragon. When translated from the dragon tongue, his name means \"Phantom Sky Hunt\". For thousands of years, his skeleton has been buried at the Kynesgrove dragon burial mound.\r\n\r\nLocal legends claim this is the dragon slain by the Nord hero Jorg Helmbolg in the First Era.\r\nSahloknir has just been resurrected by Alduin, who used his incredible power to restore Sahloknir's flesh and original appearance. Alduin did this by shouting words \"Sahloknir, ziil gro dovah ulse! Slen Tiid Vo!\", the translation of which is \"Sahloknir, I bind your dragon spirit for eternity! Flesh Time Undo!\"\r\nSahloknir is a loyal servant of Alduin. Alduin is the leader and most powerful of all dragons, and the greatest of Akatosh's creations.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!\"\r\n\"Thuri du hin sille ko Sovngarde!\"\r\n\"Your Voice is strong \u2026 for a mortal.\"\r\n\"Dovahkiin, your Voice is no match for mine!\"\r\n\"My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.\"\r\n\"My Voice has been silent for too long!\"\r\n\"I see that mortals have become arrogant while I slept.\"",
