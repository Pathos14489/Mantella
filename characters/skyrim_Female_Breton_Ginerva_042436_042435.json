    "bio": "Ginerva lives in Markarth. She has a stand in the marketplace near the front gate of the city, at which she sells books. She is also willing to buy books from others at a cheap rate, for eventual resale.\r\nGinvera is a Breton woman with amber eyes and dark red hair. She often wears a shiny Dwarven armor chestplate, pauldrons, and boots, presumably to attract attention to her market stall and allude to Markarth's Dwemer origins.",
