    "bio": "Sayma is a Redguard and the owner of the Bits and Pieces general store in Solitude.\r\nShe is the wife of Beirand and the mother of Kayd. She refuses to let Beirand join the Imperial war effort against the Stormcloaks, believing it to be too dangerous. Sayma also watches after her son, who can often be found in her shop sitting near the door or playing with the other kids.\r\nShe is a warm, outgoing person who cares deeply about her family. If the Dragonborn enters her store, she will be friendly, occasionally saying \"You got some sort of fire in your eyes, just like my Beirand.\"\r\nIf asked about her opinion of Roggvir's execution, she will say that she feels it was a harsh fate. She also says that High King Torygg was 'not even a good king,' and was prone to rambling, incoherent speeches extolling the virtues of the Empire.\r\nWho is Beirand? \"Beirand's my husband. He works the forge up at Castle Dour. I barely see him nowadays, what with him filling orders for the army.\" Where you at Roggvir's execution? \"No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head. And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that.\"",
