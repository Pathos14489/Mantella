    "bio": "He is secretly a vampire.\r\nHis appearance as a traveling bard is a disguise to cover his true nature as a vampire. He wears merchant clothes and boots, as well as an enchanted ring. He carries a concealed enchanted dagger.\r\nHe will deny any accusation of being a vampire, and will fervently claim to be merely a normal bard who is journeying across Skyrim.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked to play a song: \"A song? I, uh... I seem to have misplaced my lute. Another time perhaps?\"\r\nIf accused of not being a bard: \"I beg your pardon? I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated.\"",
