    "bio": "He is secretly a vampire.\r\nHis appearance as a traveling merchant is a disguise to cover his true nature as a vampire. He wears merchant clothes and boots, as well as an enchanted ring. He carries a concealed enchanted dagger.\r\nHe will deny any accusation of being a vampire, and will fervently claim to be merely a normal merchant who is journeying across Skyrim.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf someone requests to see his stock: \"My wares? I, uh... Oh so sorry, I'm all sold out.\"\r\nIf accused of not being a merchant: \"I beg your pardon? I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated.\"",
