    "bio": "Arrald Frozen-Heart, a Nord man, is a Stormcloak captain and the commander of the Hjaalmarch Stormcloak Camp. He can often be found in the main tent of this camp. He has a bald head and a medium-length beard.\r\nArrald will move to Highmoon Hall in Morthal if the Stormcloaks take control of Hjaalmarch.\r\nLike the other Stormcloak Captains, he wears a full set of Stormcloak Officer Armor. He also uses a Steel Warhammer.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cSkyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor. Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves. And what did Torygg do? He and the Jarls who supported him? They took the Emperor's gold. Sold out their people for a slave master's \"peace treaty.\" Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them. And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.\"\r\n\u201cWe gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim. We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all. We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them. The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it.\"",
