    "bio": "Klimmek is a Nord trader in Skyrim who resides at his house in the town of Ivarstead. He can be found on the road out of Ivarstead to High Hrothgar on various occasions. He works as a fisherman together with Bassianus Axius, who has a key to the house, and is currently searching for a job and a permanent residence in Ivarstead.\r\nKlimmek usually delivers supplies to the Greybeards at High Hrothgar, but at the time of the quest, he is unable to take the trip up the mountain. The Dragonborn may receive the supplies from him and make the trip for Klimmek. The supplies are to be placed in a chest in between the two stairways leading up to High Hrothgar's entrance.\r\nKlimmek and Fastred were romantically involved at one time, until she became more interested in Bassianus Axius. Klimmek can be persuaded to express his feelings towards Fastred and make her change her mind on leaving Ivarstead with Bassianus. During one of their conversation it is revealed that Klimmek likes to fish and she planned to leave him for Bassianus because she thought that Klimmek only loved fishing.\r\nKlimmek \"Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.\" Klimmek \"Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day.\"",
