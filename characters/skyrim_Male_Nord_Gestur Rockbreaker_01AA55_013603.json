    "bio": "Gestur Rockbreaker is a miner and resident of Stonehills. He works in the nearby Rockwallow Mine.\r\n\r\nStonehills is a small mining settlement located in the snowy eastern section of Hjaalmarch, at the base of the Skyborn Range mountains.\r\nBryling of Haafingar is the owner of the mine, from which iron ore is mined. Bryling is a wealthy woman who lives in Solitude, Skyrim's provincial capital. Bryling serves as a thane in the court of Jarl Elisif.\r\nGestur is a middle-aged Nord man. He is clean-shaven and bald, except at the sides of his head. He usually wears a belted tunic. Gestur works long hours at the mine, and is the on-site supervisor over the other miners. Notable hard-working miners at Rockwallow Mine include a man named Jesper, a woman named Swanhvir, and an Argonian man named Teeba-Ei. Teeba-Ei in particular is on good terms with Sorli.\r\nSorli (sometimes called \"Sorli the Builder\") and her husband Pactur are the managers of Rockwallow Mine. Sorli and Pactur are the informal leaders of the Stonehills community, and handle the business side of the mining operation and communication with Bryling. Sorli in particular is quite well respected in Hjaalmarch. If the Stormcloak rebellion manages to take control of Morthal (the capital of Hjaalmarch hold) and depose Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone from power, Sorli has a high likelihood of being appointed as the new jarl of Hjaalmarch. If this happens, Sorli and Pactur will move west to Morthal , and will leave their young adult son Sirgar in charge of the Rockwallow Mine's management.\r\nGestur has an adult son named Talib. Like Talib's deceased mother, Talib is a Redguard, and is skilled with magic. Talib recently started working in the mine.\r\nIf the player has any iron ore to sell, Gestur will gladly buy it from them at a reasonable rate.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you're here about the mine -- it's already got an owner, and she's not selling. If not, then please stay out of my workers' way.\"\r\n\"Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.\"\r\n\"I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.\"\r\n\"My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.\"\r\n\"You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay.\"\r\n\"I'd like us to be as productive this month as we were last month. If Bryling's happy, we're happy.\"",
