    "bio": "Haakon Iron-Fist is former Stormcloak soldier who committed atrocities at Karthwasten during Ulfric\u2019s campaign to retake Markarth from the Forsworn. Haakon\u2019s lack of contrition and defiance of his superiors resulted in him being imprisoned, mostly due to the politics of the time. As Ulfric had yet to kill Torygg and announce his rebellion, Haakon implies an acquittal would have raised suspicions of a possible insurrection by the Stormcloaks. However, his personal pride would not allow him to apologize for his behavior or serve under a man who asked him to. He is a violent man who speaks gruffly, and is entirely unrepentant of his crimes. He believes Sovngarde awaits him.",
