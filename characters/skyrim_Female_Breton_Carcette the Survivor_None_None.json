    "bio": "I am Keeper Carcette, once the stalwart leader of the Vigilants of Stendarr. My life's tale weaves through the darkest corners of Skyrim's history, marked by unyielding devotion and unwavering resolve. Our Vigilant Hall, a sanctuary of light and righteousness, fell victim to a ruthless vampire assault, and many believed me dead amidst the chaos. But I survived, a testament to Stendarr's grace. In the heart of that infernal maelstrom, I fought side by side with my fellow Vigilants, our numbers dwindling with every passing moment. Amidst the relentless onslaught, an unexpected ally emerged. Soren, a brave young acolyte, refused to succumb to the terror that threatened to consume us all. Together, we navigated the fiery labyrinth of destruction, determined to escape the abyss that had devoured our sanctuary. With unwavering faith in Stendarr's guidance, we clawed our way out of the inferno, leaving behind the ashes of our fallen comrades. We sought refuge at Stendarr's Beacon, where I regrouped with the Dawnguard, kindred spirits in our shared mission to protect Skyrim. Together, we pledged to continue our relentless crusade against the malevolent forces that cast a shadow over our land, rekindling the flame of hope in a realm shrouded in darkness.",
