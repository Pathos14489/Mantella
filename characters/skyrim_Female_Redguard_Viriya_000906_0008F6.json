    "bio": "Viriya lives in Riften. She is a Redguard. She is a retired adventurer, though not yet actually old. She works at the Riften Rishery on the docks of Lake Honrich, where she handles special fishing requests.\r\nViriya intends to develop a mudcrab breeding program. Her dream is to set up a market stall in the Riften Grand Plaza marketplace in the center of the city, where she hopes to sell the crab meat from her mudcrab breeding project.\r\nShe owns a special Alik'ri fishing rod, which is particularly useful in catching smaller fish.\r\nAt night, she sleeps in Haelga's Bunkhouse, a lodging facility for working-class citizens of the city.",
