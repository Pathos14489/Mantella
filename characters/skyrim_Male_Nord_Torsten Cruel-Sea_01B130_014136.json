    "bio": "Torsten Cruel-Sea is a Nord in Skyrim who is located in the Eastmarch city of Windhelm. He owns Hollyfrost Farm, situated just outside the city, and is a member of the House of Clan Cruel-Sea.\r\nTorsten had a daughter, Fjotli. She was killed by either The Butcher or the Summerset Shadows (specifically, their leader, Linwe). Based on dialogue however it is more likely to have been The Butcher. However that information came from Niranye, who may have wanted the identity of her murderer to be unknown.\r\nI have Fjotli's Locket. \"It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs. Tell Delvin that if he desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it.\"\r\nTorsten: \"A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines.\" Torsten: \"But imagine - fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!\" Ulfric: \"And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men?\" Torsten: \"You need but ask.\" Torsten: \"I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!\"",
