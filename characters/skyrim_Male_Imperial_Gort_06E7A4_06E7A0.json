    "bio": "Gort is a slightly deranged warrior living in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. He usually eats his breakfasts and dinners at a nice tavern/inn called The Restful Watchman. He often wanders the streets of the city. He drinks a lot. A few days during the week, he visits the local Northern Arms smithy shop in the afternoon.\r\nLike most people in Cyrodiil, is ethnically Imperial. He has a dark complexion, and a beard. He can always be seen wearing his full suit of armor armor, including his helmet. He is armed with a steel warhammer.\r\nGort is a simple man of simple pleasures, and is terse in his speech. He likes killing minotaurs, trolls, ogres, bandits, etc. Here are some examples of Gort's dialogue towards strangers:\r\n\"They call me Gort.\"\r\n\"Gort's the name, killing's the game.\"\r\n\"My hammer, a goblin's head and a mug of ale... great way to spend a Fredas night.\"\r\n\"My weapon wants-a-temperin'. Things want-a-killin'. Fetch me three iron ingots to temper my weapon, and my Book o' Killin' so I know what needs killin', then I'll give you gold.\"\r\nIf a Nord man is bothering him: \"Get away from me, you crazy snowback bastard.\"",
