    "bio": "Niyya, a Redguard woman, is a sorcereress.\r\nNiyya is first encountered in the prison area of Highpoint Tower, on the island of Solstheim. If freed, she will tell the player that she was a miner\u00a0who was digging in Highpoint Tower with several other miners.\r\nThey found a Dunmer woman named Ildari Sarothril\u00a0and nursed her back to health, but\u00a0she attacked them in their sleep. Ildari killed several of the miners, and captured the remaining survivors. She then used the remaining miners subjects in her experiments.\r\nNiyya was kept alive by Ildari to be saved for last. Ildari\u00a0was told by voices in her head\u00a0that Niyya was pretending to be her friend and ally, but was planning to betray her. She planned to save Niyya for last, saving a \"special\" experiment for her that would take time to arrange.\r\nIf the player frees Niyya, she will head to the The Retching Netch inn in Raven Rock, near the southwestern tip of Solstheim. She will thank the player for saving her.",
