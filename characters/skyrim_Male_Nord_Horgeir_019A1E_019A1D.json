He says that she is spiteful and unloving.\r\nHorgeir's wife Olda will ask the Dragonborn to retrieve his favorite mead from a secret hiding spot. Once they retrieve it, they can choose to either return it to her or Horgeir. If they decide to return it to Horgeir, he will offer them a Block skill increase.",
