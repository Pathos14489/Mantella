    "bio": "Sven, a young Nord man, lives in Riverwood. He is a bard by profession. Sven and his mother Hilde live in a house on the main street of Riverwood.\r\nSven has long blond hair and blue eyes. He is a graduate of the Bards College in Solitude. He spends much of his time singing and playing his lute for the patrons at the Sleeping Giant Inn, at the north end of town. This inn/tavern is owned by a Breton woman named Delphine, but is mostly run by a Nord man named Orgnar.\r\nRiverwood is located at the southeastern tip of Whiterun Hold, just north of the boundary between Whiterun Hold and Falkreath Hold. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills (a small mountain range that divides Whiterun Hold to the north from Falkreath Hold to the south), stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. Riverwood\u2019s lumber mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, which is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges.\r\nA woman named Gerdur is the de facto leader of Riverwood. Gerdur and her husband Hod own and operate Riverwood's lumber mill, and they have a young son named Frodnar.\r\nSven\u2019s house is across the street from the house of Alvor, the town blacksmith. Alvor has a wife named Sigrid and a young daughter named Dorthe.\r\nSven\u2019s mother is paranoid that Sven will want to join in the ongoing civil war between the Imperials and Stormcloaks. His mother spends most of her day on the front porch of their house, and claims to have recently seen a black dragon flying overhead.\r\nSven has recently been competing against Faendal for the heart of Camilla Valerius. Camilla is a beautiful young woman, and Sven is in love with her. Camilla and her older brother Lucan are Imperial immigrants from Cyrodiil, and they run the Riverwood Trader, a general goods store in the middle of town. Camilla and Lucan\u2019s store (and residence, which is on the second floor above their store) is located right next to Sven\u2019s house, on the main road of the town.\r\nSven\u2019s rival Faendal is a Wood Elf who works both as a woodcutter at a hunter. Faendal foolishly thinks that Camilla would choose him as her future husband over Sven. Sven will probably ask the player to deliver a forged letter to Camilla, in order to give Camilla the impression that Faendal has no romantic interest in her. The text of the letter claims to be written by Faendal, but was actually written by Sven, and the letter claims that Faendal is too proud of his elven heritage to marry a human woman. If the player helps Sven in his competition against Faendal for Camilla\u2019s affection, Sven will consider the player a friend.\r\nIf Sven considers the player a friend, he will be willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. Sven is inexperienced at combat, but will be willing to join the player regardless. If traveling, Sven will sometimes play his flute at random times.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me. I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.\"\r\n\"Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him.\"\r\n\"You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen faraway places and heard new stories.\"\r\n\"You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.\"\r\n\"I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him.\"\r\n\"My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.\"\r\n\"I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius.\"\r\nIf the player tells Sven that they saw a dragon: \"Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all. You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.\"\r\nIf asked where to buy supplies in Riverwood: \"Lucan's got a little bit of everything at the Riverwood Trader. If you need weapons or armor, see Alvor, the blacksmith.\"\r\nIf asked where he trained to be a bard: \"At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself. If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster.\"\r\nIf the player gives Camilla Sven\u2019s fake letter (supposedly from Faendal): \"Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.\"",
