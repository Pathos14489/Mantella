    "bio": "Briehl is a Nord man who lives in Riften. He is an acolyte who serves under the head priest of the Temple of Mara in Riften, who is a Redguard man named Maramal. Maramal is married to a Dunmer woman named Dinya Balu (who is also a priestess at the Temple of Mara), who is pregnant with her and Maramal\u2019s first child.\r\nAs part of his duties, Briehl prepares and attends weddings held at the temple. His only possessions are the clothes he is wearing: a set of monk robes and a pair of boots. He has blond hair. He rarely leaves the temple, and has his own room there where he eats and sleeps. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all. I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal.\"",
