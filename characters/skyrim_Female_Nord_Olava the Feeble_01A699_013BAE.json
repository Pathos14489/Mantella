    "bio": "Olava the Feeble is an Elder fortune teller who lives in Whiterun. During the day, she is usually seen outside her house sitting on the bench. Her house is located behind Breezehome.\r\nOlava has ties with the Dark Brotherhood, and Ahkari's Khajiit caravan. She is the key to finding an upgraded version of shrouded armor called the ancient shrouded armor. After reading the Dragonborn's fortune, she may exclaim, \"By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?\"\r\nShe also predicts the attack on the Dark Brotherhood by the Penitus Oculatus, and about the Dawnstar Sanctuary. However, the Dark Brotherhood members cannot be warned about the attack.\r\nA note found in the Smuggler's Den implies that she is a skooma dealer for Ahkari.\r\nOlava will tell the Dragonborn their fortune if they have Olava's Token.",
