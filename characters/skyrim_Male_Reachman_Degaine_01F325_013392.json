    "bio": "Degaine is beggar who lives in the city of Markarth. Before suffering a crippling injury, he worked for an orc named Mulush gro-Shugurz at the smelter outside Cidhna Mine. Degaine lives a cumbersome existence in The Warrens, where Markarth hides the poor and sick. Degaine can often be found in The Warrens or inside the Silver-Blood Inn. He sometimes lounges around the market stalls near the city gate, or simply wanders around. He is a Reachman, a descendant of the native inhabitants of the Reach. He wears nothing but some ragged robes. He is bald and has a thick brown beard.\r\nHe has a bitter and hateful attitude, and is usually loud and insulting when others approach him. He loves drinking and will happily accept any alcoholic drinks or money from others, though he rarely actually expresses gratitude for such gifts because he feels entitled to them due to his crippled status.\r\nAt the Silver-Blood Inn, Degaine often talks with Cosnach. Cosnach, a fellow Reachman, is a porter for Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, but currently has no work to do because Forsworn attacks on trading caravans have crippled trade within The Reach. \r\nWhen in the marketplace near the city gate, Degaine often argues with a fat Nord man named Hogni Red-Arm. Hogni is a butcher who sells raw meat from his market stall.\r\nDegaine has been trying to convince someone to steal a valuable child-sized gold statue of Dibella from the Temple of Dibella in Markarth. A guy from Riften has promised Degaine 300 gold in exchange for this statue. Degaine recently attempted to steal this statue himself, but he failed. If someone steals this statue from the temple and gives it to Degaine, Degaine will reward them with 150 gold (half of what the man from Riften promised him).\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Alms. I said 'alms' you backbiter! Give a crippled worker a helping hand.\"\r\n\"Bring more gold next time.\"\r\n\"Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!\"\r\nAfter receiving a charitable donation: \"Finally. Now get lost!\"\r\n\"How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims. I feel like living it up.\"\r\n\"Tell everyone you see to bring me some septims.\"\r\n\u201cYou see that Temple? Way up there? All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no. But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for.\"\r\nIf someone steals the statue of Dibella: \"Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that. Here's your share. Nicely done.\"",
