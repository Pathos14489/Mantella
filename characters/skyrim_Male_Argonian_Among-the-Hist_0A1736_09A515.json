    "bio": "Among-the-Hist is a member of the Order of the Virtuous Blood, which is based in the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. He is an Argonian with brown-green scaly skin and yellow reptilian eyes. He usually wears dark hooded robes.\r\nBefore he came to Skyrim, he hunted vampires for the Order along with his partner Arlas. Nearly four years ago during a mission, a vampire was able to rake his talons across Arlas' back, infecting Arlas with form of Sanguinare Vampiris that acted faster than normal. When Among-the-Hist asked Arlas for his last request, Arlas said \"cure me\". Among-the-Hist thought Arlas to be joking and then killed Arlas before he became a vampire. Months later, Among-the-Hist found Arlas' journal and was horrified that Arlas' last request actually had been literal, as Arlas was corresponding with Falion of Morthal in Skyrim, regarding a promising hope for a true cure for vampirism.\r\nAmong-the-Hist recently arrived in Skyrim. After a nobleman rescued Among-the-Hist from jail after he was locked up for allegedly being a vampire himself, Among-the-Hist agreed to search for this nobleman's daughter, who was secretly a vampire. Unfortunately, Among-the-Hist had no choice but to kill this vampire girl after he tracked her to Boulderfall Cave, as it was clear that she had no wish to be cured. It was in this cave the Among-the-Hist first met the player.\r\nAmong-the-Hist is a devout believer in the Divines, and trusts that everything that happens is part of their divine plans.\r\nAmong-the-Hist is willing to follow the player on their adventures, as long as they aren't a vampire.\r\nAmong-the-Hist speaks with the usual Argonian speech mannerisms. For example, instead of saying \"I will follow you\" he would say \"Ours is to follow you.\"\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Ours is a life consumed by blood. I have lost family to wars great and small, wars on the battlefield and in the mind.\"\r\n\"Wars blur the lines of morality, until we know naught whether victory is a triumph of the spirit, or a failure to be civil.\"\r\n\"Before coming to Skyrim, I had spent my life hunting vampires for The Order. Much like the Vigilants, we often hunted in pairs.\"\r\n\"My partner was a nightblade named Arlas. He used stealth and shadow to eliminate our targets, while I covered him from a distance. His was a remarkable courage. Many in The Order prefer long range attacks, to avoid the chance of infection. Arlas was never deterred from his methods. Courage alone, however, was not enough to prepare us for what lay in that den, nearly four winters ago.\"\r\n\"This is how the Divines act. Not through direct force, but through a subtle nudge, an encouraging word, or a favorable wind.\"\r\n\"Amazing. Truly the Divines have shaped this land so that we may bask in its beauty.\"\r\n\"I wonder if the Divines have granted me the wisdom to judge who should live and who should die.\"\r\n\"In life, even the most pernicious parasites die. Yet vampires reproduce and their numbers only swell. This is why they must be hunted.\"\r\n\"I was married once, you know. We lived in a small town, west of the Imperial City. I never told her about my life in The Order.\"\r\n\"The Rift reminds me of my wife. Hers was an Argonian with jewels on her horns, sunlight on her breath, and scales as vibrant as the autumn leaves.\"\r\n\"I thought Arlas' death brought me to Skyrim to save the nobleman's daughter. Now I wonder if they have brought me here to meet you.\"\r\n\"I wish to follow you on your quest. I do not know to what end, but ours is to trust in the will of the Divines.\"",
