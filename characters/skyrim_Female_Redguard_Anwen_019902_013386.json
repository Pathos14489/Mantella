    "bio": "Anwen serves as a priestess at the Temple of Dibella in Markarth, the capital of The Reach. She is a Redguard. She usually wears hooded monk robes. She is somewhat skilled with magic, and knows the following spells: Conjure Familiar, Flames, Heal Other, and Fast Healing. She usually speaks tersely, and does not suffer fools.\r\nAnwen serves under Hamal, the head priestess. Hamal is an older Nord woman, and is often referred to as \u201cThe Mother\u201d by the other priestesses. Other priestesses at the temple include Senna and Orla.\r\nDibella, the Goddess of Beauty, teaches mortals to seek truth through beauty and worship. Those who follow the teachings of Dibella, propagating beauty and promoting harmony, are granted charm and grace. Dibella and her worshipers have what can be considered a personal relationship, in contrast to the formal and impersonal relationship held by the worshipers of other Divines. A number of cults dedicated to Dibella can be found in Cyrodiil, High Rock, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and are varied in their focus. Some cults of Dibella focus on women, artists or aesthetics, while others concentrate on erotic instruction. Dibella makes her will known to mortals through her sybil, who is revealed to her priesthood via the ceremony known as the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil. This secret ceremony is known only to the priesthood of Dibella. The newly-chosen sybil is usually a child, who then leaves her parents to live in the temple.\r\nFollowing the recent death of the former sybil, Dibella has now chosen a new sybil - a girl named Fjotra from a small village to the northeast of Markarth.\r\nAnwen is an eligible bachelorette. In order for a potential suitor to win her respect and favor, they will likely need to perform a great act of service to Dibella and her temple. An example of such a service would be finding Fjotra, the new Sybil of Dibella, and escorting her to Markarth via the treacherous roads of The Reach.\r\nUnless she gets married, Anwen is so devoted to her duties as a priestess of Dibella that she almost never leaves the Temple of Dibella. If she gets married, she will naturally be willing to live with her new spouse. Accustomed to a large living area, she will expect a potential spouse to provide a large home, especially if they plan on having (or adopting) children. In order to earn extra money for her and her new spouse, she may open up a small store near her new residence.\r\nIf Anwen gets married, her dialogue and demeanor will often be more assertive than a typical wife, but she will still speak tenderly when appropriate.",
