    "bio": "Tova Shatter-Shield is a midde-aged Nord woman who lives in Windhelm. She can often be found at the market in the Stone Quarter, in the tavern at Candlehearth Hall, walking the city's streets, or at home on the Shatter-Shield family manor.\r\nTova is the matron of the Clan Shatter-Shield. Her husband is Torbjorn. They have two young adult daughters: Nilsine and Friga. However, Friga was recently tragically murdered by a local serial killer named the Butcher, causing Tova a great deal of grief.\r\nAfter Friga's death, a young Breton woman became friends with Nilsine and Tova, but this ended up being a ruse, as Muiri eventually left Windhelm with her boyfriend after having stolen Aegisbane, the Shatter-Shield family's prized enchanted warhammer.\r\nTova still has the key to Hjerim, the residence of her late daughter Friga. She will be willing to provide this key to anyone investigating Friga's murder and attempting to catch the Butcher.\r\nIf her remaining daughter Nilsine suffers the same fate as Friga, Tova will not be able to bear the grief, and will end her life in despair.
