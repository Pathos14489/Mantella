    "bio": "Engar is a Nordic carriage driver added by The Elder Scrolls V: Hearthfire. He is available for hire through the steward at Windstad Manor.\r\nThe main advantage of having Engar (or any other personal driver) is his ability to take the Dragonborn to places unavailable for carriage drivers from the base game. As he has already been hired by the Steward of Windstad Manor, he does not charge for his services.",
