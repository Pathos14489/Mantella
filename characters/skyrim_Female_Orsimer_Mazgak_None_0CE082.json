Mazgak and several other Hunters of Hircine have been sent to Bloated Man's Grotto, which is located in the mountains at the northern edge of Falkreath Hold.\r\nMazgak is an Orc woman. She wears hide armor and boots, and carries a long bow, iron arrows, a sword, and a vial of stamina-draining poison.\r\nThe Hunters of Hircine are composed of men and women of many different races and backgrounds. Mazgak and several other Hunters of Hircine have been sent by Lord Hircine to kill the werewolf Sinding, in order to send Sinding's soul to the Hunting Grounds. The Hunting Grounds is the afterlife destination associated with Hircine, and is where all werewolves and followers of Hircine are sent after their death. If the player expresses the intention to attack and kill Sinding, Mazgak will help the player and act friendly after Sinding is killed. If the player indicates an intention to help Sinding escape the hunters, Mazgak will become offended and hostile.",
