    "bio": "Jala is a Nord\u00a0food vendor\u00a0residing in the city of Solitude.\u00a0She is typically found at her stand selling produce during waking hours, and in her house at night. She is living together with Ahtar, with whom she is in a relationship.\r\nJala hates the Stormcloaks due to the fact that they killed her brother in Whiterun.\r\nShe also seems to be concerned about her shipments being attacked, mainly by the Blackblood Marauders. After the completion of the quest \"Lights Out!\" she will be overjoyed at the fact that they have been killed, and she will admit her relief at how her shipments are coming in on time.\r\nJala is also present at Roggvir's execution, where she can be heard saying \"Some gate guard you were!\" and \"You betrayed us!\", indicating her political views.\r\nShe relies on an iron dagger for her defense, but carries no other weapon and knows no spells.\r\nI bet you get some interesting people through here. \"Not lately. Business has been slow.\"",
