    "bio": "Illdi, a young Nord woman, is a student at the Bards College in Solitude. She has brown hair and blue eyes.\r\nIlldi holds a great deal of respect for Dean Inge Six Fingers, an old woman who is one of Illdi\u2019s teachers at the College. Illdi gets the impression that Dean Pantea Ateia (an Imperial woman who is another one of Illdi\u2019s teachers) doesn\u2019t like her very much. Illdi is very insecure, and feels that she is not very well-liked by most people. She generally spends her evenings wandering around alone in the courtyard outside the College.\r\nIlldi can sometimes be seen at the performing with the flute at the Thalmor Embassy west of Solitude, during parties hosted by Ambassador Elenwen.\r\nA Redguard man named Ataf, who is the youngest student at the Bards College, might have a crush on Illdi.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College...\"\r\n\"Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?\"\r\nIf playing at the Thalmor Embassy: \"These parties are a great way to earn a little extra money.\"",
