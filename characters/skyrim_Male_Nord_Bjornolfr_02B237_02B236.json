    "bio": "Bjornolfr is a deceased Nord man whose corpse can be found in the tunnel beneath Hrodulf's house, located near the southwestern tip of the island of Solstheim.\r\nBjornolfr came to Solstheim\u00a0from Solitude, searching for his lover (a man named Hrodulf) after receiving some bizarre correspondence from him. Hrodulf's Journal, found inside the house, shows the decay of Hrodulf's state of mind. Hrodulf had been sleeping in the basement of the house, due to an obsession with the Dwemer workings beneath it. Hrodulf's mad ramblings and long absence ended up bringing Bjornofr to the house to find him.\r\nBjornolfr's body is located in the Dwemer tunnel below the house, carrying a bloodstained letter from Hrodulf. After finding Hrodulf's dead body, Bjornolfr took his own life with a dagger.",
