    "bio": "Katria is a Nord woman who is now deceased. Her dead body and her ghost can be encountered within the Dwewer uin knows as Arkngthamz.\r\nKatria was the adventurer who discovered Arkngthamz. She kept a journal in which she took detailed notes about her findings, particularly as they relate to her quest to find the Aetherium Forge. She was the owner of a special bow named Zephyr, a Dwemer bow with an enchantment that gives it a fast fast draw speed.\r\nKatria entered the ruins of Arkngthamz in hopes of finding a way to prove that her former student (a Dunmer man named Taron Dreth) stole her work and published it as his own in his book \"The Aetherium Wars\". Katria hoped that finding the Aetherium Forge and crafting something from it would prove that Taron is a fraud. During Katria's journey into the ruins, she was unable to reach her goal, setting off a trap that caused a massive earthquake. As Katria tried to escape, the ground opened up underneath her and she fell to her death.\r\n\r\nKatria's ghost normally follows the player sporadically throughout the player's quest to find the Aetherium Forge. Katria's ghost makes brief appearances at each shard location found and helps mainly during the initial and latter parts of player's quest.",
