    "bio": "Geldis Sadri is the Dunmeri landlord of The Retching Netch cornerclub in Raven Rock. He sells food and drink, including Ashfire Mead, rents rooms for ten  and, like bartenders elsewhere, is a good source of rumors.\r\nPersuade, intimidate, or bribe Sadri to allow Bralsa Drel back into The Retching Netch, after he banned her, not being able to \"see the poor girl drink away her last coins any more.\"\r\nIf spoken to, he will give the Dragonborn ten of Sadri's Sujamma, a special drink he says he has perfected. He asks that the sujamma be offered to the people of Solstheim. Many, including members of the Redoran Guard, will reject the sujamma. The Dragonborn can drink the sujamma from the inventory or store it.\r\nSadri assists the Dragonborn in finding members of the Ulen family present in Raven Rock. Sadri has no involvement in the quest after this.\r\nThe Redoran Guard have spotted a pack of werewolves in the mountains. The hunters up at Frostmoon Crag might know more.\r\nSpeaking with Geldis is one way of starting the quest and leading to Ralis Sedarys.\r\nWhy did you ban Bralsa Drel from your inn? \"Have you seen the poor girl? She's a mess. She used to be richer than Councilor Morvayn and she's spending it all drowning her sorrow. As much as I love making coin, I can't watch her do that anymore. I won't.\"",
