    "bio": "Anise is an elderly Nord woman who lives just southwest of Riverwood. She can often be found gardening or sitting on a chair outside her cabin. Her log cabin home is located not too far of the point at which Lake Ilinalta transitions into the White River, flowing northeast. Her cabin is not too far south from Bleak Falls Barrow and its accompanying mountains.\r\nShe appears indifferent to anyone just visiting, but is secretly a witch and will become hostile if she sees anyone stealing from her or if anyone enters her cellar, which contains an arcane enchanter and an alchemy lab, as well as various alchemical ingredients. There is also an unsent letter in the cellar which indicates that she desires to create a witches coven. The letter is address to a woman named Helgi, and reads as follows: \"Helgi, dear, why do you hesitate? You can feel the power coursing in your blood! You have only to reach out and grasp it! Renounce that boy of yours and come, come live with me in the forest. My sister will be here soon. Together, we can form a proper coven, and your training will truly begin.\"\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm just a poor old woman, dear. No need to trouble yourself with me.\"\r\n\"It's so nice to have a visitor.\"\r\n\"It's tough just scraping by out here, but I make do.\"\r\n\"I get so lonely out here.\"\r\nIf the player finds her secret cellar: \"Fool! None may know my secret!\" ",
