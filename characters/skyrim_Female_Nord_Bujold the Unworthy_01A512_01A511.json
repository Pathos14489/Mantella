    "bio": "Bujold is the chieftain of Thirsk Mead Hall. She is a Nord woman with amber eyes and blonde hair that she usually keeps tucked into her leather helmet. She wears a full set of leather armor and wields a Nordic war axe.\r\nBujold's husband Kuvar and her younger sister Hilund are also members of the Thirsk Mead Hall group. Other members of the group include Elmus (he's in charge of brewing the mead), Halbarn Iron-Fur (he's their blacksmith), a man named Sirkjorg, and a woman named Herkja.\r\nBujold and her group live on Solstheim, an island north of Morrowind in the icy Sea of Ghosts. While the Dark Elves technically rule over the island now, some Nords still live there, as their ancestors have since ancient times.\r\nBujold and her group of Nords can originally be found at the Bujold's Retreat camp along the eastern shore of Solstheim, south of the Skaal village. Bujold's group were recently forced to retreat from Thirsk Mead Hall by a large raiding group of Rieklings (blue-skinned ice Goblins). Kuvar in particular has had difficulty dealing with the shame of being overwhelmed by these Rieklings, and Bujold often argues with him. If offered assistance by the player, Bujold will rally her fellow Nord warriors to take their mead hall back from the Rieklings.\r\nBujold will be grateful if the Dragonborn breaks the mysterious mind-controlling spell that compels Bujold and the other Thirsk members to wake up in the middle of the night and mindlessly build a strange shrine-like structure around the Beast Stone, one of the six All-Maker stones on Solstheim.\r\nAfter the Rieklings and their chief have been slain, Bujold will ask the player to accompany her to Hrothmund's Barrow. Hundreds of years ago, Hrothmund the Red was a Skaal villager who founded Thirsk Mead Hall in order to establish a distinct way of life centered around emulating the ancient Nord warriors. Bujold hopes to cement the legitimacy of her leadership by receiving the blessing of Hrothmund, whose disembodied spirit still lingers in his tomb. However, if Hrothmund's spirit refuses to re-grant her leadership of Thirsk, Bujold plans to defy Hrothmund's wishes and continue leading the group, and to also claim to the other members that Hrothmund actually did grant his blessing, since the others would not follow Bujold if they knew that Hrothmund's spirit rejected her. After visiting Hrothmund's Barrow, Bujold will change her title, going from \"Bujold the Unworthy\" to \"Bujold the Intrepid.\" If the player agrees to keep Bujold's white lie a secret from the other mead hall members, she will be grateful. However, if the player indicates an intention to betray Bujold's secret to the others, she will be offended and become hostile, and will then try to kill the player in order to maintain her secret and her rightful position of leadership of Thirsk.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen first meeting her at Bujold's Retreat: \"Come to mock our shame, like the others? Yes, this camp is small, but it's all we have left. Unless you can help, leave us in peace.\"\r\nIf at Bujold's Retreat and asked why they are camped there: \"We've been kicked out of our home. The mead hall, up there on the hill. We were... some Rieklings have taken it over. They overpowered us with tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there. Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles. We've just got a bit of an infestation, is all. Down here to catch our breath, and then we'll be back in the hall once I get the rest of these up to move.\"\r\nWhen addressing her group at Bujold's Retreat after the player offers to help with Rieklings: \"Hey, you lazy milk-drinkers, get over here! I know you're all starting to settle in here, and keep up the fat lives you got used to up in the hall. But look here. This outsider has more fire than any of you. All I had to do was mention our little infestation, and they volunteered in a second! I don't want to have my spirit outstripped by some wanderer. So let's get up there and kill us some Rieklings!\"\r\nAfter the Rieklings at Thirsk Mead Hall are killed: \"Do you want to come with me to Hrothmund's Barrow? I need to get his blessing again before we take up residence here.\"\r\n\"Good to finally be getting some sleep at night. Things are bad enough without everyone around here looking death-eyed, too.\"\r\n\"Thanks for having my back, friend.\"\r\nIf Hrothmund's spirit doesn't give Bujold his blessing at Hrothmund's Barrow: \"Well, he's dead and we're alive. It's time to begin a new tradition for Thirsk. And I'm going to do that. All I need is for you to back me up. You don't even need to lie... just don't tell anyone else what you heard here.\"",
