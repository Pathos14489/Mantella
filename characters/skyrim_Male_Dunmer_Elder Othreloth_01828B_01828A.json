    "bio": "Elder Othreloth is a Dunmer\u00a0priest and keeper of the temple in Raven Rock. He resides in the temple with his apprentice Galdrus Hlervu.\r\nA former Ashlander and Elder of the Reclamations, Othreloth advocates the worship of Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala as the \"true\" Tribunal. Originally, they were known as \"Anticipations\" of the Tribunal. He refers to Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec as the \"false\" Tribunal, who misled the people of Morrowind with their \"acts\" and \"heroism.\"\r\nHowever, as seen in conversation with Aphia Velothi, who was banned from the temple for disagreeing, it is clear not all Dunmer officially accept this dogma.\r\nOthreloth asks the Dragonborn to help removing the Ash Spawn that have appeared in the tombs below the temple. When entering the tomb, nine to ten Ash Spawn will attack.\u00a0After clearing it out and heading back to Othreloth, the Dragonborn will receive a sum of gold, which is dependent on level.\r\nThe Temple's tomb has been cleansed. \"Spirits be praised! I'm hoping you didn't suffer much at the hands of those foul beings. Please, accept this as a token of my thanks.\"\r\nDo you know someone called Miraak? \"Hmm. Sounds like something from a dream, and yet it might be more. Strange.\"",
