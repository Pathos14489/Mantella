    "bio": "Sharamph is an elderly Orsimer wise woman residing in the stronghold of Mor Khazgur in The Reach.\r\nBeing the oldest and the wisest of the Orcs at Mor Khazgur, she is one of the most respected members of the community. The residents of the stronghold come to her seeking advice and guidance, so that they can remain true to the Code of Malacath. She serves as their spiritual leader, performing ceremonies in which she reads the entrails of an animal.\r\nLike most Orc wise women, she is the mother of the chief, in this case Larak. She has two daughters-in-law named Bagrak and Shuftharz. Borgakh the Steel Heart and Olur are her grandchildren.\r\nBeing the local alchemist, she sells potions and ingredients. Her workshop is next to Larak's Longhouse, and contains an alchemy lab, along with some ingredients and potions.\r\nSharamph appears to wear Hooded Black Mage Robes, but she actually wears regular Black Mage Robes, along with a Shrouded Hood. This hood is normally only obtainable from the Dark Brotherhood.",
