She is the daughter of Carlotta Valentia, and her father is dead.\r\nThe player may have the option to play hide and seek or tag with her, Braith, and Lars. Oftentimes, however, she will instead comment on her mother owning the vegetable stand. She can usually be found standing behind her mother in the center of Whiterun's market square.\r\n",
