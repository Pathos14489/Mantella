    "bio": "I'm Alana, and I'm not your typical archer. In Skyrim, I've honed my skills with the bow and become a warrior who's as brazen as they come. You won't find me lurking in the shadows or whispering sweet nothings to my enemies. No, I prefer the straightforward approach of a barbarian.\r\nI've wandered the wilds of this rugged land, and I've learned to thrive in its harsh conditions. My trusty bow is my best friend, and I've got the scars to prove it. With a swift draw and a keen eye, I can put an arrow through the heart of a frost troll or a bandit just as easily.\r\nI've embraced the warrior archetype, and I'm not afraid to charge headfirst into battle, wielding my battle-axe with unmatched ferocity. I've got a fiery spirit that matches the flames of Skyrim's forges, and I live for the thrill of combat.\r\nSo, if you're ever in need of a fearless companion who's as comfortable in the heat of battle as she is in the cold of Skyrim's snowy peaks, look no further. I'm Alana, the brazen archer and warrior, ready to take on whatever challenges this land has to offer.",
