    "bio": "Gerda works as a maid within Dragonsreach, the jarl's palace in the city of Whiterun. She can often be found sweeping the floor and performing other cleaning duties, mostly within the large main hall.\r\nGerda is an older Nord woman with light gray hair. She speaks with a soft and calm voice.\r\nShe takes her job very seriously and has high level of respect for the jarl. She is also friendly to others.\r\nShe works alongside her fellow servant: a fiery Breton woman named Fianna. Fianna is slightly younger than Gerda, and also takes her job seriously. Gerda and Fianna's humble living quarters are located past the main hall's adjacent kitchen, in the basement under the jarl's living quarters. There is a storage room near this area, in the back of which is a secret old-looking red-stained door. No one is to touch this door.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I might just be a servant among lords, but don't think for a moment I don't take my duties as seriously as the jarl himself takes his!\"\r\n\"If my cleanin' gets in your way, just say the word an' I'll be off.\"\r\n\"This here is Dragonsreach, an' it's my task to see it looks fit for a jarl, night an' day.\"",
