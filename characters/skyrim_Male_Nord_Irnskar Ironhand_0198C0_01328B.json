He wears a set of iron armor.\r\nIrnskar guards and maintains Bryling\u2019s house in Solitude. He can often by seen conversing with Bryling, discussing subjects such as the Civil War between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, and administrative matters (such as rent and tax collection).\r\nOctieve San, an elderly Breton man, owes Irnskar a substantial of money from gambling debt.\r\nIf Bryling dies, Irnskar will temporarily serve as a Thane in her place until a more suitable replacement is found.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Unless we have specific business, I'm not interested.\"\r\n\"When I was a young rascal, I broke a man's arm with a single punch. Course, I had a horseshoe hidden in my glove...\"\r\n\"I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff\".",
