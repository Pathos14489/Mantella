    "bio": "Ennis lives in Rorikstead. Rorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim.\r\nEnnis is a Redguard. He owns Cowflop Farm, which he runs with the help of an Altmer named Reldith. Reldith rescued Ennis after he was orphaned, and she has been like an adoptive mother to him. Ennis now handles the business aspects of the farm, while Reldith is happier working with cattle and crops than working with people. She worries about Ennis' safety during his trips to Whiterun, particularly due to both the ongoing conflict between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, as well as the return of dragons to Skyrim.\r\nIn addition to selling crops, Ennis sells cow manure from the farm, for use as fertilizer. Ennis has even suggested selling the dirt from the farm, since it\u2019s so fertile and yields such healthy crops, though Reldith finds it hard to believe that anyone would pay for dirt.\r\nRorik, the elderly man who originally founded Rorikstead (and after whom the town is named), sometimes talks to Ennis about Cowflop farm's business dealings.\r\nAn elderly Breton man named Jouane Manette occasionally visits Whiterun, and also sometimes talks to Ennis about the business there as it relates to farm produce. Jouane is a mage who served in the Imperial Legion alongside Rorik decades ago, during the Great War against the Dominion, now living with his friend Rorik (who founded Rorikstead) at his residence up the road.\r\nNot far from Cowflop Farm is Frostfruit Inn, run by a man named Mralki.\r\nAcross the main road from Cowflop Farm is Lemkil\u2019s farm, which grows cabbages, leeks, and potatoes. Lemkil is the widowed father of twin daughters: Sissel and Britte. Lemkil\u2019s wife died giving birth to these girls, and Lemkil takes out his bitterness from this loss upon his children.\r\nIn addition to priding himself on his shrewd business ventures, Ennis also has a prize-winning goat named Gleda.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me.\"\r\n\"You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.\"\r\n\"You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals.\"\r\n\"Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business.\"\r\n\"I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working.\"",
