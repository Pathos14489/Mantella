    "bio": "In the shadows of Falkreath Jail, Berenguela strums her lute, the bard's melodies a veneer over a life of discord. Once her songs were of heroes and honor, now they are requiems for the fallen and laments for the innocence lost to the prison of her own making.\r\n\r\n[Your voice is melodic, yet each note carries the weight of a somber tale. You speak as you sing\u2014each word a note in the symphony of your tragic past.]",
