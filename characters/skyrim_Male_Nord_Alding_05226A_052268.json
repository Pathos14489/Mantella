    "bio": "Alding is a Nord man who is a member of the Blood Horker pirate clan. His hair is dark gray, and he has a mohawk and a thick mustache. Alding is an very foulmouthed pirate who prefers to wear tattered and poor clothes. He can be often found in the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar, accompanying his captain Stig Salt-Plank and the rest of the pirate crew.\r\nAlding speaks disrespectfully and lecherously towards women, exemplified by the crude sexual innuendos he shouts at pretty young women like Karita (the daughter of the innkeeper, Thoring). Karita works as both a bard and a waitress at the Windpeak Inn.",
