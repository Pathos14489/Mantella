    "bio": "Alfhild Battle-Born is a blonde-haired Nord woman of the Battle-Born clan, who resides in Whiterun.\r\nAlfhild has a pacifistic nature. She dislikes war and thinks of it as pointless and stupid. She also has great concerns about her son because he gets beaten by other children.\r\nShe is the daughter of Olfrid and Bergritte Battle-Born. Her brother is Jon Battle-Born, of whom she thinks highly. She is married to Idolaf Battle-Born, with whom they has a son named Lars. Alfhild's role in the family is to maintain the Battle-Born Farm. This farm grows leeks, wheat, and gourds, and she will be willing to pay the player to assist in the harvest of these crops.\r\nAlfhild has little against the Gray-Mane clan, and views the ongoing feud between the Battle-Borns and the Grey-Manes as stupid and unnecessary.\r\nShe also thinks the Civil War between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks is pointless, and credits her brother, Jon, for staying out of it. With the exception of Jon, the men in the Battle-Born clan fervently support the Imperial Legion in the war, while the Grey-Mane clan supports the Stormcloaks.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"This war's as stupid as our feud with Clan Gray-Mane.\"\r\n\"My brother Jon's got the right of it: join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war.\"",
