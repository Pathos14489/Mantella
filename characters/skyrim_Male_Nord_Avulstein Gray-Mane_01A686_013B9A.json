    "bio": "Avulstein Gray-Mane is a Nord and member of the Gray-Mane clan, a well-established family in the city of Whiterun. Avulstein is the son of Eorlund and Fralia Gray-Mane. Olfina Gray-Mane is his sister, and Vignar Gray-Mane is his uncle. Avulstein\u2019s brother Thorald is currently missing. Avulstein has light-colored hair and a thick beard.\r\nAvulstein hides in the Gray-Mane clan house, and is paranoid about meeting the same fate as his missing brother. He is certain that the Battle-Borns are behind the disappearance of his brother and wants proof stolen from the Battle-Born residence.\r\nAvulstein carries a Skyforge steel battleaxe, and wears scaled armor and scaled boots.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"This was such a glorious city. But then everything had to change. The Empire came... and my brother was lost...\"\r\n\"My brother Thorald was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead. But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where. I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him. So I need someone to find that proof for me.\"\r\n\u201cThe Battle-Borns are the Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun. Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind. They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back. Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.\"\r\n\"Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away! I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it.\"\r\n\"Forget Solitude or Windhelm. Whiterun was the crown jewel of Skyrim before... well, before... nevermind.\"\r\n\"Ah, but Skyrim! Skyrim is supreme among all nations! Our people, our native people, are unmatched in all Tamriel!\"\r\n\"One day the war will end and the true sons of Skyrim will inherit this great realm.\"\r\n\"We're getting Thorald back, no matter what.\"",
