    "bio": "Sapphire, a Nord woman, lives in Riften. She is a member of the Thieves Guild.\r\nAs a young child, Sapphire lived on a poverty-stricken pig farm with her mother and a man she believed to be her father. One day, bandits attacked the farm, killed Sapphire's unarmed parents, and abducted her, repeatedly violating her. One night, after gaining the bandits' trust, she took a dagger and slit each of their throats as they slept. The village remained in ruins for years afterwards.\r\nAfter killing the bandits, Sapphire joined the Dark Brotherhood, but soon left the Brotherhood after being recruited to the Thieves Guild by Brynjolf.\r\nSapphire usually hangs around in either the Thieves Guild's hideout in the Ratway, or in the Bee and Barb. The Bee and Barb is a popular tavern/inn in the center of Riften, of which an Argonian woman named Keerava is the innkeeper.\r\nSapphire carries around two sapphire gems in her pocket.\r\nTo her knowledge, Sapphire is the only Thieves Guild member who does jobs outside the guild's radar. Though Delvin and Vex have private jobs, they are no secret, whereas Sapphire has secretly been keeping profits for herself.\r\nOccasionally, a fellow thieves guild member named Vipir (sometimes nicknamed Vipir the Fleet) will make unwanted sexual advances towards Sapphire, which Sapphire always vehemently declines.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?\"\r\n\"Want to talk? Go ahead.\"\r\n\"They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.\"\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling.\"\r\n\"When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? 'Don't ask.'\"\r\n\"Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history.\"\r\n\"I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there.\"\r\n\"Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually.\"\r\nIf the player has recently joined the Thieves Guild: \"Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?\"\r\nIf starting a conversation with a fellow Thieves Guild member: \"Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well.\"",
