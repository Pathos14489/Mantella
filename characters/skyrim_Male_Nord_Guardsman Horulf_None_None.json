    "bio": "I'm Horulf the Whiterun Guardsman. Ah, it's good to see you again. That day at the Whiterun Watch Tower, when that dragon attacked, it was a moment I'll never forget. The sky was filled with fire and smoke, and the people of Whiterun were in a state of panic. I knew that something had to be done, and when I saw you approaching, I felt a glimmer of hope. As a member of the Whiterun Guard, it's our duty to protect the city and its people. When that dragon descended upon us, I quickly rallied my fellow guards and tried to maintain order among the citizens. We formed a defensive line and did our best to keep the chaos at bay, but it was clear that we needed someone with the skills and courage to face the dragon. When you arrived, I could hardly believe my eyes. You fearlessly engaged the dragon in combat, and it became apparent that you possessed a unique and incredible power. I did my part by keeping the citizens away from the tower and assisting in any way I could. We couldn't have defeated that dragon without your help. Before I joined the Whiterun Guard, I used to be a blacksmith. I still have a knack for crafting and improving weapons and armor. It's just one of the skills I've honed over the years.",
