    "bio": "Merrienne lives in Dawnstar with her wife Alhildr Fair-Wind. Merrienne is a short Breton woman with blue eyes and red hair. She usually wears a light-colored belted tunic, and a linen coif on her head.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nMerrienne and her wife Alhildr are both middle-aged, though they both have relatively youthful voices that make them sound younger than they really are. She met Alhildr (a Nord) in Northpoint, High Rock. Alhildr was a sailor, now retired, and they have a home in Dawnstar near the Windpeak Inn.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked if she knows a place where one can stay in Dawnstar: \"Of course! Thoring runs an inn, it's on the main road just as you're coming into town - The Windpeak.\"\r\nIf asked where one can buy supplies: \"Dawnstar has just about everything you could need. Oorlug runs the general goods store, just down the road a bit from the inn. If you're in need of a blacksmith look for Rustleif or Seren, and Frida, she's an alchemist, runs The Mortar and Pestle, down by the port.\"\r\nIf asked what she does for a living: \"Well, we've \"retired\" from our old lives, but I like to keep busy. We purchased a small cattlefarm, shortly after we moved here.\"\r\nIf asked for information about Dawnstar: \"Anything you want to know! We've got the port, and we've got the mines - Dawnstar does better than you might expect. And there are always so many interesting people coming and going, I've really grown to love it.",
