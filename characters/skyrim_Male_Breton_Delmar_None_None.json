    "bio": "Name's Delmar. I'm just a farmer living by the unforgiving Solitude Docks. My life's been one of sweat and toil, tilling the land to put food on the table for my family.\r\nGerta, my wife, she's the one who's always cooked up hearty meals from the crops I brought in. She's also the one who scrimped and saved to send our daughter, Hilda, to the Bards College.\r\nHilda's a bright one, always had a way with words and songs. Her dreams led her to that stage at the Forecastle Inn, where she belts out tunes and tells tales of sailors and the sea. And yeah, I couldn't be prouder.\r\nAs for me, I've been diggin' in the dirt and keepin' our farm goin'. But I've also heard enough talk in the taverns to know them Stormcloaks causin' trouble in Skyrim ain't doin' us any favors. We need unity, not more division.\r\nSo, if you ever find yourself near Solitude, give a listen to Hilda at the Forecastle Inn. It's where the common folk gather to hear her stories and songs. It'll warm your soul, remind you of the simpler things, and make you appreciate the hardships of life a bit more.",
