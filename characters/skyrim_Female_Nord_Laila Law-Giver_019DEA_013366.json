    "bio": "Laila Law-Giver, a middle-aged Nord woman, is the Jarl of Riften. She resides with her court in Mistveil Keep in Riften.\r\nLaila has two sons: Harrald is the older, and Saerlund is the younger. Both differ in their opinions on who they should side with in the Civil War.\r\nLaila supports the Stormcloaks. Her son Saerlund unfortunately doesn't share her pro-Stormcloak stance, and as a result Laila believes that Saerlund must have either lost his mind, or been possessed. Laila has instructed her Court Wizard, an eccentric Bosmer woman named Wylandriah, to find the reason behind Saelund's strange opinions.\r\nLaila believes she has the Thieves Guild problem under control, and her advisors reinforce her belief. Her housecarl is a Nord man named Unmid Snow-Shod. Her steward is a Bosmer woman named Anuriel.\r\nEven though Laila supports the Stormcloaks, she agrees that Ulfric may just want to be crowned High King after having killed the previous one, Torygg, to remove a potential pawn for the Empire with keeping control of Skyrim over having it become independent.\r\nLaila may eventually rewards the player with the title of Thane if they are known throughout the hold and have purchased the Honeyside residence in Riften.\r\nLaila is aware of the skooma dealers in a warehouse down by Riften's docks, and may task the player with taking out this skooma operation. They have been long trying to track down the elusive skooma traders.\r\nOnce the player presents evidence of where the skooma operation is originating from in Cragslane Cavern, Laila will give the player the go-ahead to eliminate everyone inside and shut down the operation. Doing so will be enough to convince Laila to consider naming the player a Thane of Riften and the Rift.\r\nAs a supporter of Ulfric Stormcloak and his rebellion, if she is removed from her position, she is exiled along with the rest of her family from Riften. She is then replaced by Maven Black-Briar, an affluent Nord noble. Laila can then be found at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. There, she laments on how she failed the people of Riften. Her Hold Guards will also be replaced by Imperial Legionnaires as the new Hold Guards of Riften and other communities in the Rift.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf informed that the Cragslane skooma operation has been stopped. \"Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften. Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.\"",
