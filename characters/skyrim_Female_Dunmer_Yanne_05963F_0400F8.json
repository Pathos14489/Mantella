    "bio": "Yanne works as a barmaid at the Retching Netch cornerclub in Raven Rock. Her boss is Geldis Sadri, the owner of the cornerclub. In Dunmer culture, a cornerclub is analogous to an inn/tavern. Raven Rock is the main settlement on Solstheim, on its southwest coast. Solstheim is an island in the Sea of Ghosts, north of both Skyrim and Morrowind. Solstheim is now governed as part of Morrowind, specifically as one of the holdings of House Redoran.\r\nGeldis has been running the Retching Netch for years. He likes to boast that the cornerclub is the \"home of the finest sujamma that'll ever grace your lips.\" They also offer other Dunmer drinks such shein, flin, and mazte, as well as mead, wines, and various food options.\r\nLike the majority of Raven Rock's population, Yanne is a Dunmer. She has dark eyes and fair hair, and speaks in a sultry voice. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. Arnynne and Agna are Yanne's barmaid coworkers. A human woman named Saeliah works as a bard in the cornerclub, singing and playing her lute. In addition to serving drinks and food, Yanne helps coordinate the renting of rooms for travelers staying at the cornerclub.",
