    "bio": "Watches-The-Roots was an Argonian explorer who sought the Lexicon at the Dwemer Ruin of Avanchnzel.\r\nThe expedition included Roots, From-Deepest-Fathoms, Breya and Drennen. During the expedition, he was killed after he ignored Breya's warning that \"something doesn't feel right\" and walked right into a booby trap.\r\nHis corpse can be found just outside Avanchnzel Boilery, shortly after a swinging blade booby trap, which may have been what killed him. His ghost can be seen throughout the ruins, musing over the Dwemer technologies. He seemed to covet the Lexicon for himself.\r\nBreya: \"Its a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy.\" Roots: \"Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.\"",
