    "bio": "Lieutenant Salvarus is an Imperial soldier and member of the Penitus Oculatus.\r\nHe can be found aboard the ship The Katariah.\r\nHe wanders around the planning room, which contains a map of Skyrim and a small library of books. He can sometimes be found sitting on one of the benches to the immediate left or right of the room, making it difficult to sneak up on him.\r\nDuring the quest, Lieutenant Salvarus is aboard The Katariah\u00a0and is one of the Emperor's guards along with Captain Avidius. They are at different quarters of the ship. Both of them can be killed and looted, providing the Katariah Master Key which unlocks the Emperor's Quarters.",
