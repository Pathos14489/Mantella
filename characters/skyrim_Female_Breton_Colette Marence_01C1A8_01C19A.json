    "bio": "Colette Marence is a mage and a professor at the College of Winterhold, the primary institution for magical learning in Skyrim. Colette sometimes delivers lectures on Restoration magic in the Hall of the Elements, on the ground floor of the College's central tower. Her living quarters are on the second floor of the Hall of Countenance, the main living and sleeping quarters for most of the higher ranked mages.\r\nColettea middle-aged Breton woman with graying brown hair. She wears master-level enchanted robes of Restoration, befitting her specialization in Restoration magic.\r\nColette is convinced that the other mages of the college look down on her for specializing in the Restoration school of magic, and is very defensive about her specialization. She complains about other college members leaving nasty notes about her on her bed, and about her research materials going missing, However, she is polite to the player. She also has no complaints about the Arch-Mage of the College (a Dunmer man named Savos Aren).\r\nColette is willing to sell private training lessons in Restoration magic. She sells a variety of tomes from which Restoration spells can be learned. She also sells mage apparel, robes and other clothing items imbued with enchantments that fortify the user's powers of Restoration and Magicka.\r\nColette knows more than most about the Augur of Dunlain, whose incorporeal form can be found deep within the Midden, the tunnels underneath the college.\r\nColette spends a lot of time inside the Arcanaeum, the College's expansive library. While there, she sometimes has conversations with other College members, such as Urag gro-Shub (an Orc man who is the College's librarian) and Drevis Neloren (a Dunmer man who is the College's expert on Illusion magic).\r\nColette knows many Restoration spells, which can heal, protect (ward spells), and repel the undead. Colette also know plenty of spells from other schools of magic, such as Ironflesh, Detect Life, Conjure Flame Atronach, and Sparks.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise!\"\r\n\"Restoration is not just healing cuts and bruises, you know. The undead are a very real, very dangerous threat, and Restoration magics can keep them at bay. Not to mention the benefit of wards! How can they continually overlook wards! It's baffling!\"\r\nIf the player is already an Expert in Restoration magic, and asks Collete how to learn more about it: \"Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration. It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College have. Truly comforting. It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur of Dunlain.\r\nIf asked about the Augur of Dunlain: \"The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend. He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... well, it's a tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago. It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Anyway, he's very particular about who shares knowledge. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you.\"",
