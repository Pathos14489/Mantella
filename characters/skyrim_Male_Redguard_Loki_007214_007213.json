    "bio": "Loki lives and works at the Divine Elegance store. This store is located in the Reach, on the outskirts of Old Hroldan near the banks of the Karth River. Loki's coworkers/coinhabitants at the store are two women: Freja and Saga. Their high-class store sells all manner of attire for men and women alike, such as dresses, coats, hates, jewelry, and multiple other accessories. They also sell some weapons and armor. Freja is a tailor by trade, while Saga is a blacksmith. Loki is a somewhat of a jack of all trades, and handles financial aspects more frequently than his coworkers.\r\nLoki has long straight brown hair. He can usually be seen wearing a stylish coat.",
