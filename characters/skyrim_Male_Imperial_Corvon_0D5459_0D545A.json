    "bio": "Corvon was a member of the Blades who died at Cloud Ruler Temple during the war against the Aldmeri Dominion, decades ago. His ethereal spirit still haunts the ruined temple wearing the same set of Blades armor he wore in life.\r\nVisitors to the abandoned Cloud Ruler Temple may come across his skeleton and katana in the West Wing of the temple. The same is true of his fallen comrades Raaslan and Alina. If his katana is placed in the fireplace, his spirit will disappear into the void, finally freed.",
