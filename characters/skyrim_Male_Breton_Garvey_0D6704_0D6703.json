    "bio": "Garvey is a Breton and Expert-level Sneak trainer. He is the assumed boss/leader of the people living in the Warrens.\r\nGarvey is generally found standing at the entrance in the Warrens, a series of tunnels underneath Markarth where the impoverished sleep.\r\nOn the Dragonborn's hunt for information on the Forsworn agent, Weylin, Garvey can be persuaded, intimidated, or bribed to relinquish the key to Weylin's room. If the Dragonborn has contracted a disease, or is very poor Garvey can respond with acceptance rather than the normal line of not belonging.\r\nIf questioned about Weylin himself, Garvey seems less concerned about Weylin's murderous deed than who will occupy the Reachman's room next.",
