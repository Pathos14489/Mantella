    "bio": "Alesan is a orphaned boy who currently lives in Dawnstar. He is a Redguard.\r\nAlesan and his father were on a boat when his father became sick. The crew dropped the two off in Dawnstar. His father died a few days later. Alesan now delivers food to the miners of Quicksilver Mine and Iron-Breaker Mine, to make money to survive. He also feeds chickens. At night, Alesan sleeps in a bedroll on the floor of the Windpeak Inn. This inn is run by a man named Thoring, who has a young adult daughter named Karita.\r\nAlesan would love to be adopted.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen working during the day: \"I'm running food and supplies to the miners. Don't pay much, but they let me sleep by the fire in the inn most nights. I'm late! Gotta run!\"\r\nWhen at the Windpeak Inn in the evening: \"Whew! I'm worn out.\"\r\nIf asked where his parents are: \"My parents are... dead. My Pa was a sailor. Took me with him on his last trip. After he got sick, they... put us off here and left without us. He... died a few days later. I've tried to make do since then but... it's been hard. Real hard.\"\r\nIf someone offers to adopt him: \"Really? You mean it? Wow, thanks! I promise, I won't be any trouble at all! Just... just let me get my things and say goodbye to everyone. I'll meet you at home. Thanks! Thanks again!\"",
