    "bio": "Captain Lonely-Gale is a Nord man, former sailor, and resident of the city of Windhelm. He has dark brown hair and a beard. His outfit consists of fine clothes and a pair of fine boots, and he is wealthy enough to be considered rich. He also carries a steel sword on his hip.\r\nThe citizens of Windhelm continue to address him with the honorific \"Captain\", because was the captain of a ship before he retired. He is somewhat despondent about his wife\u2019s death. Despite this, he is friendly and helpful with advice about things to do in Windhelm. Unlike many Nords in Windhelm, he doesn\u2019t harbor any ill will towards the Dunmer in the city.\r\nHe enjoys a rather relaxed life in Windhelm, spending a lot of his time in Candlehearth Hall (the popular inn near the center of the city, in the Stone Quarter), where he sometimes chats with Elda Early-Dawn (the middle-aged Nord woman who works as Candlehearth Hall\u2019s innkeeper) while ordering a drink. In the morning, he can often be found browsing stalls in the market square in the southwest section of the Stone Quarter.\r\nHis recent widower status has attracted the romantic interest of Viola Giordano, an older Imperial woman who spends a lot of time in Candlehearth Hall and constantly worries about The Butcher. The Butcher is the name that the people of Windhelm have given to the elusive man who has been murdering young women in Windhelm and carving up their bodies. Captain Lonely-Gale is starting to get quite annoyed with Viola\u2019s repeated expressions of romantic interest in him.\r\nNiranye, an Altmer woman who works as a general goods merchant in Windhelm\u2019s market, sometimes asks Captain Lonely-Gale if he can refer her to any of his old sailor associates for a business proposition. Wary that Niranye is interested in smuggling, he will deny Niranye\u2019s request.\r\nIf Brunwulf Free-Winter replaces Ulfric Stormcloak as the Jarl of Eastmarch (as a result of the Imperial Legion capturing Windhelm), Captain Lonely-Gale will agree to serve as the Windhelm court steward.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Fair winds and calm seas. That's an old sailor's parting.\"\r\n\"The townsfolk call me \"Captain\" because I used to be a sailor.\"\r\nIf asked who some of the prominent citizens in Windhelm are: \u201cThere's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction. The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city. And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King. Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent.\"\r\nIf asked about things to do in Windhelm: \"If you're looking to pass the time, you can give Calixto a few Septims and gawk at whatever oddity he's come across lately. If you're in need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall.\"\r\nIf asked why people refer to him as a captain: \u201cFolk just call me that because of what I used to do. I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader, and in time, I bought my own ship. When I retired here in Windhelm, most folk already knew me as Captain Lonely-Gale, and the name just stuck.\"\r\nIf asked about the recent murders: \"Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm. He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet. All lovely ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe.\"\r\nIf asked what the news on the street is: \"The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.\"\r\n\"I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired.\"\r\n\"I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going.\"",
