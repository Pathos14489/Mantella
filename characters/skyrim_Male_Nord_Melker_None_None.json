    "bio": "Aye, I'm Melker, a student at the College of Winterhold with a clear focus on the school of Destruction magic. I believe that channeling all your energy into a single school of magic is the key to true power, and that's why I'm committed to specializing in Destruction. My rivalry with Myvrana is well-known in these halls. She's a bit of an odd one, wanting to be a jack of all trades. We often lock horns over our differing philosophies. Our debates can get pretty fiery, but we still respect each other's choices, even if we don't see eye to eye. As for Lentilus, that Conjurer fella, I've got no patience for his kind. Conjuration magic just doesn't sit right with me. Why call upon otherworldly beings when you can harness the raw power of destruction yourself? It's a matter of pride for me, and I'm determined to master Destruction magic to show everyone in Winterhold the true might of a Nord mage.",
