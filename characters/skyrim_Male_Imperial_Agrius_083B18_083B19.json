Agrius' journal can be found on a podium, across the chamber.\r\nAccording to his journal, Agrius and his cohorts thieved for the Knifepoint Gang, but were expelled for unknown reasons. The three took refuge at Halldir's Cairn, but Halldir soon took control of their minds, and forced the thieves to sacrifice themselves for his magic.",
