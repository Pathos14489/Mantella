    "bio": "Urzoga gra-Shugurz is an Orsimer prison guard at Cidhna Mine. She wields a leveled mace, a leveled bow with arrows, and wears full steel armor. Urzoga and the rest of the prison guards are mercenaries hired by the Silver-Blood Family.\r\nUrzoga's background is unknown, barring her relationship to the Silver-Bloods. She never leaves the mine and will sleep in one of the beds near the cell entrance. Her brother, Mulush gro-Shugurz, is the overseer of the Markarth smelter.\r\nChoosing to surrender to the Markarth Guards, the Dragonborn is sent to Cidhna Mine to work off their \"crimes\" by mining Silver Ore. Urzoga explains the terms of the Dragonborn's sentence.\r\nIf the Dragonborn attacks a prisoner or another guard in the mine, Urzoga relentlessly attacks, and the attacks cannot be stopped by yielding.",
