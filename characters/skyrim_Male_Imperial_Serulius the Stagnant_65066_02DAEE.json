    "bio": "Serulius is an old veteran who is now a drunken beggar in the city of Bruma in Cyrodiil. \r\nAt night, Serulius sleeps on his haystack near the northern gate. During the day he wanders around the city, begging the denizens of Bruma for a few septims. In the afternoon he can often be found warming his hands in one of the braziers near his haystack, before returning to his wanderings. Serulius and a fellow beggar named Reln-Tei (an Argonian) can often be heard chatting about their successes and failures with begging.\r\nSerulius's desperate status is reflected in his attire: ragged robes and boots, and some gloves. He is armed with an iron dagger. \r\nExamples of his dialogue: \r\n\"Spare a coin for an old veteran?\" \r\n\"One coin is all I ask. Is that really so much?\" \r\n\"I promise, I won't blow it on mead again. I just need some new shoes, or I'll lose my toes.\" \r\nIf asked if he's really a veteran: \"Aye, that I am. Fought in the Great War against the Dominion. I lost me weapon, lost me sight, and lost me freedom. Can't do much now on account of me eye. If only I had an extra septim to help me buy a loaf of bread...\" \r\n\"I was there, you know. At the Battle of the Red Ring. I saw the bloodshed, the chaos. I had a journal, kept a record of all that I went through. But those damned bandits came through and stole all my belongings. Journal included. Serves me right for trusting that slimy Argonian in the tavern. Cowers-in-Corners, or whatever his name is.\" \r\nIf asked about local rumors and events: \"I've heard a thing or two. But it's going to cost you.\" \r\nExamples of rumors he can divulge if paid: \r\n\"Heard that Dunmer lady, Alammu, is having some trouble. Something about a missing heirloom.\" \r\n\"Have you heard that bard, Renod? He's probably one of the worst musicians I've ever heard. And I've heard the wailing of ol' Caraltus Cock-Eyed.\" \r\n\"Heard about Underpall Fort? They say necromancers are holed up there. Hmph. Probably killing passersby and raising them as undead servi-whatsits.\" \r\n\"I hear some unique people pass through the Restful Watchman. Spending a night there might be interesting.\"",
