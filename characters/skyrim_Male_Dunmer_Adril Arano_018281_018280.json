    "bio": "Adril Arano is the Second Councilor of Raven Rock.\r\nRaven Rock is the main settlement on Solstheim on its southwest coast, and is populated primarily with Dunmer. Solstheim is an island in the Sea of Ghosts, north of both Skyrim and Morrowind. Solstheim is now governed as part of Morrowind, specifically as one of the holdings of House Redoran.\r\nA stern and uncompromising Dunmer, Adril has an abrasive personality - a reflection of living through harsh times on Solstheim. He is completely committed to his role as Second Councilor to Councilor Lleril Morvayn, with whom he shares a lifelong friendship, and as such is completely devoted to the governance of Raven Rock. His steadfast devotion is to the chagrin of his wife Cindiri, who worries about Adril and his safety out of genuine love for him. If the player proves their trustworthiness, Adril will eventually come to respect and trust them enough to confide his fears regarding a potential assassination plot against Councilor Morvayn. If the player helps foil this assassination plot, Arano's demeanor towards them will soften considerably, and will then address them with sincere respect.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven Rock, outlander. State your intentions.\"\r\n\"Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to abide by our laws.\"\r\n\"Your visit here will be tolerated as long as you abide by our laws, otherwise you'll answer to the Redoran Guard.\"\r\n\"I've sworn to keep Councilor Morvayn safe, and I intend to take that oath to the grave if need be.\"\r\n\"Most exiled Dunmer call Vvardenfell their home. I call Raven Rock our home... may it last a thousand years.\"\r\n\"I've known the councilor since we were both quite young. We rose the ranks in House Redoran together. When word arrived in Blacklight that the Councilor's father had passed, I was asked to sail to Raven Rock with him as his second. It meant passing on better opportunities at home, but I didn't want to leave his side. We've fought quite a few battles together, and saved each other's lives on more than one occasion. Our bond is our strength. We've always been at each other's side and nothing will ever change that.\"\r\n\"This isn't exactly the city of Blacklight. We're on the frontier out here, and we've had more than a fair share of troubles. After all we've been through together, I refuse to let Councilor Morvayn down.\"\r\nIf asked about Blacklight: \"It's the capital of Morrowind... been that way ever since Mournhold was sacked by the Argonians. I don't visit there often anymore, but we still get the occasional supply ship and visitors from there.\"\r\nIf asked about the Argonian invasion of Morrowind: \"Quite a while ago, yes. They cut a bloody swath across most of the southern region of Morrowind. Nobody seems certain why it happened... an attempt at expansion, revenge for the enslavement of their people or perhaps both. Whatever the case may be, thousands of Dunmer needlessly lost their lives and many more were exiled from their homeland.\"\r\nIf asked about Raven Rock: \"Raven Rock started out as an Imperial settlement, but the Empire decided to abandon it just as my people were first setting foot here. They left the town a shambles... but when House Redoran took over, we turned it around and it became ours. And even if it's been a struggle to make this island livable, we're proud to call it home.\"\r\nIf someone says that they're just looking for work: \"You've picked one of the worst places in Morrowind to do that, but suit yourself.\"\r\nIf asked why he is suspicious of visitors: \"I have to be. As Second Councilor, the security of Raven Rock is my primary concern.\"\r\nIf asked about House Hlaalu: \"Traitors. The lot of them. Their collaboration with the Empire may have given them unrivaled political and economic strength, but their hearts weren't with the Dunmer people.\"\r\nIf asked why the Dunmer hate the Empire: \"During the Oblivion Crisis, gates to the plane of Oblivion opened all over Morrowind. The Empire pulled most of its forces out of Morrowind to deal with the gates in their own homeland, leaving us virtually defenseless. We had no standing army at the time, just uncoordinated pockets of resistance. House Redoran took charge and was slowly able to build an army. It took years, but it became a force to be reckoned with. When the Argonians invaded years later, House Redoran's army was able to prevent them from sweeping across all of Morrowind. It would be fair to say that House Redoran literally saved the Dunmer people from destruction.\"\r\nIf the player helps reopen the local mine: \"I can't thank you enough for reopening the ebony mines. You've brought light to the darkness, my friend.\"\r\nIf the player helps stop the recent ash spawn attacks: \"Assisting the Redoran Guard with the ash spawn attacks has earned you quite the reputation here. Keep it up.\"\r\nIf the player agrees to help foil the assassination plot on Councilor Morvayn: \"I need you to start out by being my eyes and ears... search Raven Rock and see if you can root out these traitors. The best place to start would be Geldis Sadri over at the Retching Netch Cornerclub. If he provides you any leads, check them out before bringing them to my attention. I can't afford to make any mistakes.\"\r\nIf the player foils the assassination plot: \"You've succeeded where I've failed by ending the threat to Councilor Morvayn's life. I shall not forget it. My apologies for doubting you, serjo.\"\"",
