    "bio": "I'm Guardsman Vilkhelm. Well met, friend. That day at the Whiterun Watch Tower, when the skies turned infernal, I tell you, I thought I'd seen it all in my years as a guard. Bandits, wolves, giants, even the occasional bear, but never a bloody dragon. It was a sight to behold, and not in a good way. When that winged terror descended, we rushed to the scene. Arrows flew, and shouts of defiance filled the air, but we were like ants trying to swat a dragon. When you came charging in, I didn't know who you were, just another adventurer, I thought. I did my part, firing arrows at the beast, trying to keep it distracted, but to be honest, I never expected anyone to face down a dragon like that. The gods themselves must have been watching over us that day. Something about me, you ask? Well, when I'm not on guard duty, I spend my time brewing mead. Got a little cellar tucked away, and I've been experimenting with different recipes.",
