    "bio": "Garrett is a ghost. In life, he was a member of the Blades at Cloud Ruler Temple in Cyrodiil, and was an expert swordsman. Garrett followed and taught the Way of the Nine, a school of swordsmanship in which each of the Nine Divines is associated with a different style of swordplay.\r\nGarrett was slain by a Khajiit woman named S'vashni, who was his apprentice. Unfortunately, S'vashni does not revere the Divines, and is obsessed with becoming the best swordsman. She needs to be stopped before she causes more harm to others.",
