    "bio": "Brynjolf, a Nord man, is an important member of the Thieves Guild in Riften. Brynjolf is currently the second-in-command at the Thieves Guild, below only Mercer Frey (the current Guildmaster). Brynjolf wears fine boots, fine clothes, the Amulet of Articulation (which magically increases the wearer\u2019s ability to persuade others), and he carries two daggers. He had red shoulder-length hair.\r\nIf Brynjolf meets the player on the streets of Riften, he will direct them to the Ratway, the underground tunnel system underneath Riften, explaining that there is a tavern there called The Ragged Flagon, and states that if the player can make their way to the Flagon, they can join the Thieves Guild.\r\nOnce the player reaches the Flagon, Brynjolf will be impressed, and as a further initiation test before joining the Thieves Guild, Brynjolf will ask the player to collect some debts owed to him from several of the shopkeepers and business managers in Riften, namely Keerava (an Argonian woman who runs The Bee and Barb inn), Haelga (a Nord woman who runs The Bunkhouse worker lodging facility and who is known for her Dibella worship and sexual promiscuity), and Bersi Honey-Hand (a Nord man who runs The Pawned Prawn general store). After these debts have been collected, Brynjolf will then introduce the player to Mercer Frey, the Guildmaster, and officially induct the player into the Thieves Guild.\r\nVex, a prominent thieves guild member, recently failed in her attempt to infiltrate Goldenglow Estate, a honey farm owned by Aringoth which is located on a group of small islands in Lake Honrich, to the west of Riften. Maven Blackbriar, the matriarch of the most influential family in Riften, is a major client of the Thieves Guild, and has hired the guild to infiltrate the estate. Maven contracts Goldenglow with supplying the honey for her Blackbriar Meadery, but Aringoth has recently hired mercenaries to guard the honey farm and has abruptly stopped doing business with Maven. Brynjolf may ask the player to perform the task of infiltrating Goldenglow Estate and find out why Aringoth has been doing this.\r\nBrynjolf will help the player by providing information and advice for future thieving jobs. He seems to care for the other Thieves Guild members, like Vex (an Imperial woman whose hair is white despite Vex not being particularly old), Delvin (a Breton man), Sapphire (a Nord woman) and many others. There is a rumor going around that Tonilia (a Redguard woman who isn\u2019t officially in the Thieves Guild but works closely with them) has been cheating on her boyfriend Vekel (who owns and operates The Ragged Flagon tavern) with Brynjolf, but there isn\u2019t any truth to this rumor, and both Brynjolf and Tonilia will firmly deny any romantic or sexual relationship between them if asked. \r\nBrynjolf can often found wandering around the Thieves Guild\u2019s cistern and the Flagon.\r\nIf Mercer Frey dies or is removed from his position as guildmaster of the Thieves Guild, and if the player has completed important thieving jobs that significantly increase the guild\u2019s influence in the cities of Whiterun, Markarth, Windhelm, and Solitude, Brynjolf will nominate the player to be the next guildmaster, and will also reward them with the Amulet of Articulation.\r\nBrynjolf seems to be fond of children, since children living in Riften sometimes mention Brynjolf giving them treats and promising to teach them \"neat things\" when they grow older.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cReady to make some coin?\"\r\nIf the player asks about an old man hiding in Riften: \u201cYour guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is.\u201d\r\n\u201cMy organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes. But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from... if you think you can handle it. The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon. Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got what it takes.\"\r\n\u201cHonestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored. A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.\"\r\nIf asked about Bersi: \"Bersi is as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find. The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.\"\r\nIf asked about Keerava: \"Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for family. Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're\u2026 well acquainted, if you catch my meaning.\"\r\nIf asked about Haelga: \"Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.\"\r\nAfter the player has officially joined the Thieves Guild: \"Welcome to the family. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.\"\r\nIf talking about the Goldenglow Estate infiltration job: \u201cThe Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly. Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble. Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him. The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.\"",
