    "bio": "Nelkir is the youngest son of Balgruuf the Greater, Jarl of Whiterun. He mentions that he knows he does not have the same mother as his brother and sister, Frothar and Dagny, information given to him by the Whispering Lady.\r\nNelkir usually makes sarcastic or condescending remarks when the Dragonborn walks past him. This changes after completing the quest \"The Whispering Door,\" where he seems to become less rude.\r\nAfter talking to Jarl Balgruuf about his youngest son, the Dragonborn will be able to speak to Nelkir about his activities regarding the Whispering Lady. He will speak to the Dragonborn about the secrets she has told him and to go see for themselves. He will also aid in telling the Dragonborn how to obtain the key to the door.",
