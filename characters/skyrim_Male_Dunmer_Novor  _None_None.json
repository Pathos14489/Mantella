    "bio": "I'm Novor, a mage who dabbles in the 'questionable' arts. Some of my earlier experiments had me expelled from the College of Winterhold. Subsequently, I moved to Windhelm and have taken up residence in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in an attempt to drink my sorrows away. I'm looking for a practical outlet for my skills and an opportunity to try out some new ideas I have brewing away in that little head of mine. I would jump at the chance to go investigating old crypts. You can usually find me upstairs in New Gnisis, proficient in Destruction Magic.",
