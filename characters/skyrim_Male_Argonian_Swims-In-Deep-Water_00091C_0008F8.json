    "bio": "Swims-In-Deep-Water is an Argonian who lives in Riften. He works as the master angler of the Riften Fishery on the docks of Lake Honrich. He is willing to take an apprentice fisherman under his tutelage.\r\nHe owns a special Argonian fishing rod, which is particularly useful in catching larger fish. He is also the current holder of the ancient Fang of Haynekhtnamet artifact, a dagger with a powerful shock damage enchantment that was carved long ago from the fang of a Wamasu beast.\r\nSwims-In-Deep-Water is the author of the five-part \"Fishing Mastery\" book series.\r\nHe will be very happy if someone finds and returns his lucky fishing hat, and will reward them with 400 gold.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"So you have decided to learn how to fish! Good for you! It's a noble endeavor, and with plenty of practice, it can be profitable one. Keep in mind that every journey begins with a single step, one that is usually clumsy and will end with you falling on your face. That is why, for your first lesson, it's recommended that you stick to calmer skies and fairer climates, where the fish will happily bite on even the most unattractive of hooks.\"\r\nIf someone finds and returns his lucky fishing hat: \"You are like my brood to me. Here. A token.\"\r\n",
