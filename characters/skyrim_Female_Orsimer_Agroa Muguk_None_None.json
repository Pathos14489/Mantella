    "bio": "Agroa, a proud Orc, finds herself in the unforgiving lands of Winterhold for a most peculiar reason. I joined this College not out of thirst for power or a love for magic, but rather to prove that Orcs, too, have a place among scholars and mages. In the strongholds, Orcs are known for their strength and martial prowess. Yet, there is more to us than brute force. I sought the College to show that an Orc can excel in the arcane arts just as well. It's a path fraught with skepticism and prejudice, but I carry the legacy of Malacath and my people with me. Agroa, the Orc mage, shall prove that the strength of mind can rival the strength of steel.",
