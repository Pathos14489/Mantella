    "bio": "Korir, a Nord man, is the\u00a0Jarl of Winterhold. He can be found in the Jarl's Longhouse in Winterhold. His wife is named Thaena, and they have a young son named Assur.\r\nKorir does not approve of the College of Winterhold, and his opinions are typically ignored by the other Jarls, due to Winterhold not being seen as one of the important holds in Skyrim. If banished from Winterhold by the Imperial Legion, he will reside in Brunwulf Free-Winter's house in Windhelm with his family.\r\nKorir's influence is deeply affected by The Great Collapse and the existence of the College of Winterhold. He carries the grudges of his ancestors while refusing to abandon his home. He continues to serve Winterhold dutifully as its staunch protector in troubled times.\r\nIf the player asks Korir for work, he will send them to recover the Helm of Winterhold, hoping to improve the standing of Winterhold.\r\nIn order to be named Thane of Winterhold, the player must help three residents of Winterhold.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked for work: \"Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that. I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era. Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority.\"\r\nIf the player has helped several of his people: \"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Winterhold. I grant you this weapon from the armory to serve as your badge of office. I'll also notify the guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.\"",
