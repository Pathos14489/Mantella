    "bio": "Dushnamub is an Orsimer and the blacksmith for the stronghold of Narzulbur.\r\nHe has his workshop set outside Gloombound Mine forging weapons and armor with the metal coming from the mine. He is the son of Chief Mauhulakh and has a sister named Urog. He states that he didn't know his real mother at all, but he was raised by the Chief and his other wives who also taught him how to be a good blacksmith.\r\nBeing a blacksmith he will sell weapons and armor and will buy any Ebony Ore at a full price. If the Dragonborn steals any ingots from the mine, or kills any of his family including Bolar, he can send hired thugs even if they remained undetected.\r\nDushnamub: \"Don't you ever wonder, father?\" Dushnamub: \"But your aunts don't even seem to care.\" Mauhulakh: \"They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.\" Dushnamub: \"I've just never heard of a midwife losing all her mothers like that.\"",
