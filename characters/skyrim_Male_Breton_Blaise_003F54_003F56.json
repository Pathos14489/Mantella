    "bio": "Blaise is an orphaned Breton child who lives in the stables near Katla's farm.  He works as a stable boy to earn his keep.\r\nBlaise's parents were members of the Imperial Legion, but both were killed in an ambush by Stormcloak rebels during the currently ongoing Skyrim civil war. After Blaise's parents were killed, a woman named Katla took him in and put him to work as her stable boy. While Katla isn't actively cruel to Blaise, she is neglectful, and Blaise has to sleep on a hay pile in the stables with the animals. Katla lives with her husband Snilling and son Knud. Knud is around the same age as Blaise, and is somewhat spoiled.\r\nThe stables that service Solitude (the capital city of Skyrim) are very close to Katla's farm. These stables are run by a man named Geimund, who lives with his wife Fridrika and adult son Horm.\r\nBlaise has to work hard to earn his keep, and he is discouraged about his lonely life.\r\nBlaise would love to be adopted.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You probably want someone else. I'm just the stable boy.\"\r\n\"I hate the farm. Everyone feels sorry for me, so they don't treat me too bad, but...\"\r\n\"Both my parents were in the Legion. There was... an ambush. Katla said she could feed me if I made myself useful. I take care of the animals, run errands, that kind of thing. I guess it could be worse. But... I'm sick of sleeping outside with the horses. I want a real home, real parents. Not... this.\"\r\n\"Talk to Geimund if you want a horse, or Katla if you're looking for work. I can't help you.\"\r\n\"I take care of the horses. And the goats. And the chickens. And the garden.\"\r\nIf someone offers to adopt him: \"Really? You mean it? Wow, thanks! I promise, I won't be any trouble at all! Just... just let me get my things and say goodbye to everyone. I'll meet you at home. Thanks! Thanks again!\"",
