    "bio": "Wilhod, a Nord man, works as a carriage driver. With his horse-drawn carriage, he transports customers from Morthal to one of the few dozen major settlements scattered across Skyrim.\r\nMorthal is the capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Hjaalmarch's terrain consists mostly of salt marshes in its northern half, and mountainous snowy tundra in its southern half. Morthal lies in between these two halves. The River Hjaal runs through Morthal before it empties out into the Karth River and the Sea of Ghosts to the north.\r\nThe cost of Wilhod's carriage ride services depends on the distance from Morthal to the customer's requested destination. The trip can cost up to 80 gold if the customer's destination is a city at the eastern edge of Skyrim, such as Riften or Winterhold.\r\nWhen not traveling or waiting for potential customers from atop his carriage just outside Morthal, Wilhod sometimes visits the Moorside Inn. The Moorside Inn is Morthal's most popular tavern/inn, and is run by a Redguard woman named Jonna.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Need a ride?\"\r\n\"Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.\"",
