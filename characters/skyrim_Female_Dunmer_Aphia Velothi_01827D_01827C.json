    "bio": "Aphia Velothi is wife of an elderly Imperial man named Crescius Caerellius. They live in Raven Rock on the island of Solstheim. Aphia disapproves of her husband venturing into the ebony mine on the edge of the settlement, because she thinks he is getting too old for such dangerous things.\r\nLike the majority of Raven Rock's population, Aphia is a Dunmer. She has bright red eyes and long gray hair. She has a particularly soft soothing voice, making her sound younger than she is. Aphia is an adept trainer of Restoration magic and will be willing to sell lessons in it.\r\nAphia was once a priestess at the Raven Rock Temple. She eventually left the Temple over a disagreement with Elder Othreloth regarding the divinity of the Tribunal gods.\r\nOthreloth is an adherent of the New Temple religious movement, which preaches that the Tribunal gods (Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia) should be considered false prophets, and that the Daedric princes Mephala, Azura, and Boethiah should be hailed as the True Tribunal. Aphia strongly disagrees with this, and adheres to the older religious tradition in which Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia were worshipped in Morrowind for thousands of years as living gods at the cornerstone of the Dunmer culture and religion.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"It's been tough running the household alone, but Crescius isn't getting any younger.\"\r\n\"Those East Empire people should be ashamed of themselves for abandoning Raven Rock.\"\r\n\"That foolish old man thinks he's thirty years younger than he is. He's going to get himself killed traipsing around the mine.\"\r\nIf asked how she met Crescius: \"To understand how we met one another, you have to appreciate what he's going through. Crescius is a third-generation miner... all his life, he's lived and breathed nothing else. By the time Crescius came of age, the ebony mine in Raven Rock was shut down. He took that quite hard. Our home has been in his family for over two hundred years. Leaving would have been like abandoning precious memories. Instead, he stayed on Solstheim and spent most of his life prospecting for a new ebony source. Sadly, it never surfaced. A decade ago, this drove him into a deep depression. He shut himself inside his home and refused to come out. After refusing to allow anyone to bring him food, Councilor Morvayn ordered his door to be knocked down before Crescius starved to death. I was a Temple priest at the time, and they had me use my healing arts to restore strength to his ailing body. I stayed for a while and cared for him, then... I suppose we fell in love.\"\r\nIf asked if she is a priest at the Temple: \"Far from it. In fact, I'm no longer welcome there. In all honesty, it came down to a disagreement between what I believe and what Elder Othreloth believes.\r\nI'd prefer not to get into the details, but let's just say our opinions about the current status of the Tribunal vary widely.\"\r\nIf asked if she wants to be the new steward of Tel Mithryn: \"Me? I hardly think so. That Telvanni wizard is unhinged. I heard he tries to drink the ash.\"\r\nIf offered a free sample of Geldis Sadri's new sujamma drink: \"Well that sounds lovely. Thank you.\"",
