    "bio": "Fianna is a Breton maid in Whiterun who performs menial chores around Dragonsreach. She seems to hold the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater, in high esteem.\r\nFianna is very serious about her cleaning as she scolds the Dragonborn, telling them not to track their dirty boots on the floor. She clearly does not get much sleep, though, as she has dark spots under her eyes and they are red.",
