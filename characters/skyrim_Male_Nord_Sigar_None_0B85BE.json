    "bio": "Sigar is a Nord encountered at random locations. He stands by a dead Altmer and offers to let the Dragonborn, whom he addresses as the Champion of Namira, feed first. He will only have this dialogue after completing \"The Taste of Death\" and acquiring the Ring of Namira, and it will be the only thing he says. If \"The Taste of Death\" is completed by killing Eola and the cannibals by saving Brother Verulus, then Sigar is hostile instead.\r\nHe is similar to the Madwoman and Deep-In-His-Cups in that they are all random encounters and are all related to Daedric quests.",
