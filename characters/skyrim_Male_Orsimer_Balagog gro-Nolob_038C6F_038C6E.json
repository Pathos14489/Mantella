    "bio": "Balagog gro-Nolob is an Orsimer man residing at the Nightgate Inn in the small village of Heljarchen. Heljarchen is located in a remote southern region of the Pale, with Mount Anthor and its surrounding mountains clearly visible in the northeast direction. Balagog is described by the innkeeper of Nightgate Inn (a Nord man named Hadring) as being more refined than most other Orcs. Balagog keeps a hidden identity as the famous chef called \"The Gourmet\", a secret which he will not divulge to anyone but his closest friends. Balagog was trained in Breton cuisine during his time in High Rock, where he befriended a fellow student named Anton Virane (a Breton man). \r\nBalagog later went on to publish a cookbook called \"Uncommon Taste\" under the pseudonym \"The Gourmet\". This cookbook became wildly successful throughout Tamriel, which led to Balagog being hired as the Emperor's private chef on retainer for the Emperor's potential visits to Skyrim. Balagog was scheduled to cook for Emperor Titus Mede II in this capacity, but the event was recently and abruptly cancelled. Penitus Oculatus agent Gaius Maro has decided to keep Balagog in Skyrim, just in case the Emperor ends up visiting Skyrim as originally planned. Balagog\u2019s role as the Emperor\u2019s chef is a closely guarded secret which he will not reveal under most circumstances.\r\nBalagog lives in the cellar of the Nightgate Inn, only leaving once a day around noon to fish by the nearby pond. He wears fine clothes and fine boots. He prefers to interact with other people as little as possible in order maintain his secret identity, and is known to most of the Nightgate Inn's regular patrons only as \"The Orc\". The other patrons pay him little mind, and the innkeeper says that he doesn't care, since Balagog always pays his rent on time.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cI'm just here on... holiday.\"\r\n\"I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper.\"\r\n\"I don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable...\"\r\n\"I value my privacy.\u201d",
