    "bio": "Bothela, an old Breton Reachwoman, is an alchemist who lives in Markarth. She wears facepaint and has long white hair.\r\nShe is the proprietor of The Hag's Cure, where she sells potions and alchemical ingredients. She has a store assistant and friend named Muiri, a young Breton woman. \r\nBothela expresses regret at the situation with the Forsworn. She has a nephew named Odvan who is a prisoner in Cidhna Mine for being a member of the Forsworn. If asked about the Forsworn, she will say that a great number of her friends and her kin were lost because they joined the Forsworn.\r\nBothela thinks that Markarth would be better off without the Silver-Bloods. Yngvar, a Silver-Blood enforcer, periodically comes to forcefully collect gold from her shop s as part of the Silver-Blood protection racket.\r\nBothela may ask the player to discretely deliver a potion called Stallion's Potion to Raerek, an old man who serves as Jarl's Igmund\u2019s steward in Understone Keep. The potion enhances a man's sexual performance and endurance for about an hour after drinking it.\r\nBothela sometimes talks to Muiri about Muiri\u2019s former lover Alain Dufont, a leader of a group of bandits. Alain tricked Muiri into thinking that he loved her in order put himself in a position to steal valuable heirlooms from the Shatter-Shield family in Windhelm, to whom Muiri was close. This pain from this betrayal still plagues Muiri\u2019s thoughts. \r\nQuote:\r\n\"A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....\"\r\nWe'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days. And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's 'ambitions.' Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear.\"\r\n\"The only thing I know about the Forsworn is that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago.\"\r\n\"I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children...\"\r\n\"Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...\"\r\n\"Not scared of an old woman now, are you?\"\r\nIf asked why her shop is called The Hag\u2019s Cure: \"Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults. Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by.\u201d",
