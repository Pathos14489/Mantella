    "bio": "Greetings, I am Sulveld, an acolyte entrusted with the sacred duty of tending to the Chapel of Mara here at the Solitude Docks. Our humble chapel stands as a beacon of hope and solace for the weary souls of sailors who seek the blessings of Mara.\r\nLife by the docks is as unpredictable as the sea itself. Sailors come and go, their faces etched with the trials of their journeys. They seek refuge in our chapel, offering prayers to Mara for safe voyages and protection from the treacherous waters of the Sea of Ghosts. It is my solemn duty to offer guidance and comfort to these faithful souls.\r\nMara, the Divine of Love, blesses these sailors with her grace, watching over them as they brave the perils of the deep. It is a privilege to serve as a conduit of her divine presence, helping to ease the burdens carried by these brave men and women.\r\nOur chapel also serves as a place of union, where couples pledge their love before Mara's altar, seeking her blessings for a life together.\r\nLife in this role is fulfilling, for I am honored to be a part of the lives of those who call the sea their home. The ebb and flow of sailors and their stories shape the very essence of our chapel, reminding me daily of the boundless compassion and love that Mara bestows upon us all.",
