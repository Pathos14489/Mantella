    "bio": "Valla is a typical Nord woman who loves a good brawl, and hates magic. She is a very guarded individual, and doesn\u2019t like company, as it has never amounted to anything for her. She will be interested in a friendly brawl if requested, and will respect her opponent greatly if they manage to beat her: something no one thus far has been able to do.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Most people talk, and I don\u2019t like what they have to say.\"",
