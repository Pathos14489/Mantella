    "bio": "I am Valla, a Dunmer bard who grew up in the countryside of the Pale. My grandparents came from Morrowind and settled in Skyrim. I attend the Bards College in Solitude, where I met Anduniel. I am a student of the flute and compose tunes. I am often commissioned to play at festivals and events across Skyrim. I will play for Anduniel\u2019s wedding if the player marries me, and I am available as a follower after completing \u201cDocks of Solitude\u201d quest.",
