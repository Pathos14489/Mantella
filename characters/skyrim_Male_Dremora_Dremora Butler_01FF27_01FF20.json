    "bio": "Dremora Butler is a Dremora encountered in The Elder Scrolls V: Dragonborn.\r\nHe can be summoned using the Secret Servant power. When activated, he appears and offers to carry any items for the Dragonborn, much like a follower would.\r\nThe Butler is highly useful when the Dragonborn is over-encumbered and no safe container is within reach and/or where one has no follower. The Dragonborn can also use him to effectively \"smuggle\" equipments into restricted, gear-removing areas such as\u00a0prisons,\u00a0Cidhna Mine\u00a0or the Thalmor Embassy.",
