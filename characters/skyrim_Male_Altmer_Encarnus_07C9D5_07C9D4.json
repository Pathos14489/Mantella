    "bio": "Encarnus is a conjurer and member of the College of Whispers, who is helping work towards turning Frostcrag Spire (in the snowy wilderness of County Bruma, in Cyrodiil) into an official cynosure. He is an Altmer, with a surly demeanor. \r\nEncarnus wears a set of College of Whispers hooded robes and hood, along with gloves, mage boots and a revenant necromancer mask. He knows spells such as Banish Daedra, Bound Dagger, Summon Zombie, Dread Zombie, Healing, Healing Hands, Lesser Ward, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Cloak, Reanimate, Sparks, Stoneflesh and Turn Undead. \r\nEncarnus sometimes summons a ghost, presumably one of a mage who lived and died at Frostcrag Spire in the past. An example of the conversations Encarnus has with these ghosts: \r\nGhost: \"Wha..? Where am I?\" \r\nEncarnus: \"You are with friends. Where you are exactly doesn't matter. Tell me, what is the last thing you remember?\" \r\nGhost: \"I... I don't know what's going on. Where's Albecius? I was supposed to meet him, but then everything went dark...\" \r\nEncarnus: \"I am sure he will be here soon, don't worry. Would you like to tell me your name?\" \r\nGhost: \"My name? My name is... oh gods, what's happening to me? Where am I? Tell me what's going on! Where's Albecius?!\" \r\nEncarnus: \"Calm down. I apologize for waking you.\" \r\nAfter disposing of the summoned ghost, Encarnus: \"Latest interrogation unsuccessful. No new information acquired.\" \r\nWhen greeting visitors, Encarnus is somewhat dismissive. \r\nExamples of Encarnus' dialogue towards visitors: \r\n\"The spire is College property. Speak to Ravil for any official business.\" \r\n\"I'm rather busy with my work; try one of the others around here.\" \r\n\"I'm not sure if you were aware of this, but the College of Whispers is a very old and very respected organization.\" \r\n\"Make sure to show the mages here the respect they deserve.\" \r\n\"Gah, what is it now?\" \r\nIf asked what he's working on: \"Cataloging. You don't need to know the details. The College of Whispers would not be named as such if we continually blurted out our findings to passerby.\" \r\nIf asked about his plague-doctor-esque mask: \"Supplied by our colleagues in Water's Edge. We may be practitioners of necromancy, but that does not mean we have to stand the intolerable stench which comes with its study. It certainly has prevented a fair bit of fainting on my end. Err, not that I would actually faint, mind you, just an expression.\" \r\nIf asked if Astor Astentius (the senile old man of their College team) is well: \"Divines, no. The old bat's mind has been slowly degenerating ever since he returned from an expedition to Hammerfell. Anyway, I have important research to return to. If you want gossip, talk to the Breton.\" \r\nIf someone says that he seems on edge: \"Do I? Well maybe it's because I have my hands full trying to set up a whole new cynosure in a dusty old ruin in the middle of a frozen wasteland. Do you think that has anything to do with it?\"",
