As for the other Greybeards, save for Arngeir, his voice is too powerful to be heard by common people, so he does not speak.\r\nAlong with the other Greybeards, the only word he says, when interacted with, is \"Dovahkiin...\" which is accompanied by the sound of a distant bell and what seems to be a small earth quake. He, along with the other Greybeards also speak the Dragon Language when the Dragonborn retrieves Jurgen Windcallers horn.",
