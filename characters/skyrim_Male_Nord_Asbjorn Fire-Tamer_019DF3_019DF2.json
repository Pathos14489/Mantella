    "bio": "Asbjorn Fire-Tamer is a Nord man who lives in Riften. He is the apprentice blacksmith to Balimund at The Scorched Hammer. He has short hair and a medium-length beard.\r\nAsbjorn was left at Honorhall Orphanage when he was only a baby; according to Grelod the Kind, his parents didn't want him (though given Grelod's cruel nature, this may not be true). Balimund adopted Asbjorn when he was a young boy in order to make the boy his apprentice. Asbjorn then quickly learned that he possessed a natural affinity for smithing  as has been working hard to learn the trade ever since.\r\nAsbjorn has deep gratitude and admiration for Balimund, and hopes to someday be as good of a smith as Balimund is. Asbjorn can be found inside The Scorched Hammer most of the day.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cI used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.\"\r\n\"Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that someday and make him proud of me.\"\r\n\"Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him.\"\r\n\"Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.\"\r\n\"At first I don't know why he picked me. I had never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!\"",
