    "bio": "Eisa Blackthorn is a bandit with a history of trouble with the law and various bandit groups.\r\nShe is a Nord woman with brown hair and blue eyes. Lines of diagonal red face paint adorn the center of her face. She wears a full set of steel armor, including gauntlets and boots. When combat is necessary, she wields a war axe and a steel shield.\r\nAfter serving a 1 year prison sentence in Cidhna Mine (an infamous prison in Markarth, run by the corrupt Silver-Blood family), Eisa joined the White River Gang, a group of bandits led by Hajvarr Iron-Hand. White River Gang is headquarted at White River Watch, a cave in the mountains in between the city of Whiterun and the Throat of the World, Tamriel's tallest peak. Eventually, Eisa and some of the other bandits started to plan a mutiny against Hajvarr, but Hajvarr's blind uncle Ulfr overheard their plan. Hajvarr and his loyal bandits then killed everyone involved in the planned mutiny, except Eisa and her friend Ra'jiir, who managed to barely escape from White River Watch with their lives. Eisa and Ra'jiir then fled to the city of Windhelm, where they heard about a group of treasure hunters near Morthal.\r\nAfter joining a bandit group led by a man named Kyr, Eisa was put in charge of their treasure hunting expedition within the ancient Nordic ruin of Frostmere Crypt. Eisa and her fellow bandits soon discovered a small hidden underground forest within this crypt, within which they discovered a sword on a monument pedestral. Kyr decided to keep this mysterious sword for himself. Shortly after Kyr removed the sword from its pedestral, Eisa's friend Ra'jirr began hallucinating about an ancient spirit named \"the Pale Lady\". Ra'jirr soon decided to steal the sword from Kyr in order to return it to its pedestral in the underground forest. Unfortunately, Kyr assumed that Eisa had worked with Ra'jirr to steal the sword for themselves, and put out a bounty of 100 gold on each of them. The other members of the bandit group then found and attacked Eisa, chasing her out of Frostmere Crypt.\r\nWhen conversed with, Eisa will speak about the existence of this accursed sword, and will express her intention to leave the area and distance herself from the sword and Kyr's bandits.\r\nAfter this harrowing encounter at the crypt, Eisa plans to head to the Moorside Inn in Morthal for a temporary respite.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Who in Dagon's name are you? Speak, or I'll cut you down where you stand.\"\r\n\"I was part of the gang in the ruins here. Friend of mine went crazy and stole the boss' sword. They blamed me for it. Look, I'm done here. Mop the floor with these idiots for all I care. Just get out of my way.\"",
