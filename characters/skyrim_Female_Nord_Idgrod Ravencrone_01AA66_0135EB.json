    "bio": "Idgrod Ravencrone is the Jarl of Hjaalmarch. She rules over Hjaalmarch hold from Highmoon Hall, her longhouse in Morthal. Morthal is the capital of Hjaalmarch.\r\nIdgrod is an elderly Nord woman with long dark hair. She is a seer of psychic visions and dreams.\r\nIdgrod appears relaxed, and chooses to quote phrases of wisdom and patience. She is quite wise and learned, though many of her people seem to think she is mentally unstable due to her enigmatic personality and affiliation with magic. Though she aligns her hold of Hjaalmarch with the Empire, she is not particularly concerned with the ongoing civil war between the Empire and the Stormcloak rebellion (a trait she shares with Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun) and also dislikes the Thalmor due to their ruthless and treacherous nature.\r\nShe associates herself with Falion, a Redguard newcomer to Hjaalmarch and a wizard. Because of their kinship, she is mistrusted by the members of Morthal. Though Falion is disliked by the much of the Morthal's townspeople, he is more altruistic than bothersome.\r\nIdgrod has an older teenage daughter named Idgrod the Younger, and a young son named Joric. She raises her two children with Aslfur, her husband and court steward. A man named Gorm is her personal housecarl.\r\nIf the Stormcloak rebellion seizes control of Morthal, Idgrod and her family will be forced into exile at the Blue Palace in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim.\r\nOut of diplomatic necessity, Idgrod sometimes attends parties hosted by Thalmor ambassador Elenwen, at the Thalmor Embassy near Solitude. If Idgrod is encountered at one of these parties, she will be happy to create a distraction if requested.\r\nIdgrod may ask a visiting adventurer to investigate a suspicious house fire in which a woman and young girl were killed. Many suspect that the man of this house intentionally set fire to his house in order to kill his family, with the end goal of entering into a romantic relationship with another woman named Alva.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome.\"\r\n\"Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open.\"\r\n\"I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen.\"\r\n\"In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl.\"\r\n\"All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.\"\r\n\"There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over 'laws' that have no real purpose.\"\r\n\"That which is unknown can cause unease, even fear. It is to be expected. Some fear our new resident wizard. As they grow to know him, they will accept him. Time will prove me right.\"\r\n\"The Divines reveal things to me at times. I do not hide this. It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.\"\r\nIf asked about her stance on the ongoing civil war: \"I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal. Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.\"",
