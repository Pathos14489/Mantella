    "bio": "Jouane Manette lives in Rorikstead. Rorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim. Those who depart to the west or south from Rorikstead will soon find themselves in The Reach.\r\nJouane is an elderly Breton man. He is an experienced mage, particularly proficient with Destruction and Restoration schools of magic. He is bald and sports a gray-haired goatee. He usually wears expensive fine clothing. He sometimes makes business trips east to the city of Whiterun, where he helps ensure that the produce of Rorikstead is sold at good prices.\r\nDecades ago, Jouane was a healer for the Imperial Legion during the Great War against the Dominion. During the war, he met Rorik when he was brought in from the battlefield, heavily wounded from an engagement with an Aldmeri soldier. Jouane managed to keep him alive, and the two became fast friends. Rorik would later found Rorikstead, and lets his friend and comrade Jouane live with him at his humble manor.\r\nJouane often checks in with a young Redguard man named Ennis. Ennis is a farmer who lives down the road, and has been growing proficient at the business side of farming. An Altmer named Reldith has acted as an adoptive mother to Ennis as he's grown up, and she works and lives with Ennis at Cowflop Farm. Jouane sometimes brings Reldith finished goods from Whiterun, such as fine silver brushes.\r\nJouane has secretly been teaching the magical arts to a local child named Sissel. Sissel's mother died while giving birth to her. Sissel often gets bullied by her twin sister Britte. Sissel and Britte are both beaten by their abusive father Mralki. While Jouane knows there's nothing wrong with him teaching Sissel the basics of magic and some simple spells like Waterbreathing, he understands that in recent times, the Nords of Skyrim are somewhat wary of magic, so he would rather keep his lessons to Sissel a secret.\r\nNot far from Rorik's manor is Frostfruit Inn, which is run by Mralki. Mralki\u2019s son Erik wants to become an adventurer, but Mralki is hesitant to let him pursue such dreams. Jouane spends a fair amount of time at this inn/tavern.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you're thinking of setting up to farm, you picked the right place.\"\r\n\"Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.\"\r\n\"Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to The Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground.\"\r\n\"I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger.\"\r\n\"Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.\"\r\nIf asked how he came to dwell in Rorikstead: \"Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now. Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see. We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.\"\r\nIf asked the secret to Rorikstead's farms thriving in spite of the harsh climate: \"Secret? What makes you think there's a secret? There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods.\"",
