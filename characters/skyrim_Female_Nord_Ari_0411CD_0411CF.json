    "bio": "Ari was a Nord bandit in\u00a0Falkreath Hold. Her corpse lies in Moss Mother Cavern, after she was killed by a spriggan.\r\nAri arrived with two hunters, Niels and Valdr, to kill a bear they hunted. The three were attacked, Ari and Niels killed by spriggan attacks, which left Valdr wounded and helpless outside of the cave.\r\nAri originally gave Valdr his dagger, telling him it would bring him luck.\r\nIf Moss Mother Cavern is visited after the events of \"Hunter and Hunted,\" there are two small cairns outside the cave entrance. These likely represent where Ari and Niels are buried.\r\nValdr requires assistance at avenging the death of his friends, Ari and Niels. To do this, they must kill the spriggans taking up the cavern.",
