    "bio": "Legate Fasendil is an officer in the Imperial Legion, commander of the Imperial forces stationed within The Rift. He is an Altmer with blond hair, and is clean shaven. He wears a set of Imperial armor with a matching pair of boots and bracers. In close combat, he relies on an Imperial sword or a steel dagger. He uses an Imperial bow for ranged combat if needed, with steel arrows as ammunition.\r\nFasendil can often be found at his post within the Rift Imperial Camp, located at the southwest corner of The Rift at the base of the Jerall Mountains, which form the boundary between Skyrim and Cyrodiil. If the Legion manages to successfully liberate Riften (the capital of The Riften) from Jarl Laila and the Stormcloak rebels, Fasendil will subsequently be re-stationed within Mistveil Keep (the Jarl's palace) in Riften.\r\nFasendil hails from Cyrodiil. He is the son of two travelling Altmer merchants who settled there. He grew up in Cyrodiil, and once he came of age he joined the Imperial Legion to see more of the world.\r\nDespite observing that the local Nords do not like outsiders in their lands, Fasendil feels that Skyrim and its people are still a part of the Empire, and as such are entitled to the Legion's protection.\r\nEven though he is an Altmer, Fasendil has strong disdain for the Thalmor and the Aldmeri Dominion. This disdain stems partly from a tragic incident (called the Night of Green Fire) in Sentinel (a major city in Hammerfell) that occurred over 150 years ago while Fasendil was stationed in Hammefell.\r\nFasendil is now stationed in Skyrim by order of Emperor Titus Mede the Second, to keep an eye on the Thalmor.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked why he joined the Legion: \"My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust. I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's just one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case. Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for.\"\r\nIf asked what it\u2019s like back home in Cyrodiil: \"Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me. Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been. Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people.\"\r\n\"Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda, the Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.\"\r\n\"The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing. But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil. And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.\"\r\nIf asked what happened during the Night of Green Fire: \"Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor. Suddenly, an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own. I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who were stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived. Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job. We're supposedly at peace now, but I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.\"\r\n\"For the glory of the Empire.\"\r\nIf asked how he feels about the war: \"You mean Ulfric's so-called Stormcloak rebellion? The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, jarls - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order. Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally. But rest assured, we'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.\"\r\n\u201cThe Legion's always been in Skyrim. We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry. Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.\u201d\r\nIf asked how to join the Imperial Legion: \"Think you've got the mettle, eh? Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess. If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tullius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim. But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.\"",
