    "bio": "Gryfard Peton is a young man who lives in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. He is a tailor by profession. He sells clothing and jewelry at his stall in the Bruma market. He is a much better tailor than he is a salesman or speaker, and has difficulty with the people-skills aspects of his job.\r\nGryfard is a Breton, from the province of High Rock. He has short light brown hair, with a thin beard. As befits a tailor, he usually wears fine Colovian clothing. He sometimes drinks a potion of glibness to boost his speaking ability.\r\nAfter a long day at work at the market, he often heads to the nearby Jerall View Inn for some food and drink.\r\nHere are some examples of Gryfard's potential dialogue while at his market stall:\r\n\"Oh, uh, greetings, customer! Would you like to buy some new apparel?\"\r\n\"You look like you could use some new clothes. I mean, not that what you're wearing looks bad!\"\r\n\"Everything you see here is for sale...well, except for the actual stall. I, uh, kinda need that.\"\r\n\"Are you interested in buying some new, uh, clothing?\"\r\n\"Quite chilly out today, isn't it? Then again, every day in Bruma is chilly...\"\r\n\"The best clothing High Rock has to offer, right here...\"\r\nIf he is asked how his business is faring: \"Alright, I suppose. My sales pitch isn't very good, I know, but I still get a fair few customers. Everyone need something to wear, I guess.\"\r\nIf someone comments on his nervousness: \"You can tell, huh? Yeah, I'm not exactly the best salesman. Don't exactly like being one either. Don't worry though, I'm a much better tailor than I am a merchant.\"\r\nIf asked why he is in this line of work: \"You know, I always thought about doing something else. Becoming an adventurer or whatnot. It's just...well, I'm just not cut out for that kind of lifestyle. As my good old ma always said, 'Gryfard, my worthless, good-for-nothing son, you got to do something with your life! And since you seem to be better at sewing than spellcasting, you had best become a clothing merchant.' So here I am. Yes, she's a lovely woman, my mother. A powerful mage, too. If you see her around these parts, though, you warn me right away. She's the reason I left High Rock...\"",
