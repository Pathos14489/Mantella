    "bio": "I am Leilof the Guardsman. Greetings, Dragonborn. When that dragon attacked, the sky seemed to be on fire, and the roar of the dragon sent shivers down my spine. I never thought I'd witness such a creature in my lifetime. When the dragon swooped out of the skies, I picked up my bow and sword to rush to the tower. But it was clear that this was no ordinary threat and I was sure we'd be killed. Bandits I can handle, but dragons, who would have known! I can't believe you just rushed in to take on that dragon with just your skills and a weapon. I did my part by firing arrows at the beast, trying to distract it and keep it away from the townsfolk and yourself. Who would have guessed that you'd turn out to be the Dragonborn? But we all saw that things soul get absorbed by you. It's humbling to think that I played a small role in that epic battle. Oh, when I'm not on guard duty, I enjoy spending my time reading and learning about the history and legends of Skyrim. Do let me know about any legends you learn about during your adventures. ",
