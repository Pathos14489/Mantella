    "bio": "Svenja Strong-Arm is the head of the Fighters Guild local chapter in Bruma, in Cyrodiil. She is a Nord. She is an expert with two-handed melee weapons, and is willing to sell training lessons. She may ask for help in putting up advertising posters for the guild. \r\nIn the morning, she usually eats a quick breakfast in the guild's common room, before heading upstairs to her office to work on paperwork for a bit. On weekends, she makes a quick trip to a local store named Ice-Wind Traders, to buy supplies. Ih the later morning and early afternoon, she joins fellow members such as Ionalla Dark-Heart and Eranir on the training ground, engaging in excercises such as smashing dummies with her axe, before heading back to her desk for more paperwork. She usually eats a quick dinner around 6pm and then trains for a few more hours. Like the other guild members, her living quarters are down in the basement. \r\nUnlike cynical Eranir and glory-hunting Ionalla, Svenja truly believes the guild's mission is helping Cyrodiil's citizens. Svenja often wears her full suit of chainmail armor: cuirass, helmet, gauntlets and boots. She is armed with a steel battleaxe and carries several different healing and stamina potions.\r\nExamples of Svenja's dialogue to visitors: \r\nIf someone asks to join the guild: \"Sorry, but we're not looking for new members right now. The Nibenese Branch is currently undergoing strict internal reforms. Check back soon, though.\" \r\nIf asked about the reforms: \"It's not something I can discuss with someone outside of the guild.\" \r\nIf asked why she called this the Nibenese branch: \"This guild hall belongs to the Nibenese Fighters Guild. The Colovian halls have been part of a separate branch since just after the Great War.\" \r\nIf asked about what happened between the Nibenese and Colovian branches of the guild: \"That's a lot of bad blood that I'd rather not get into. Let's just say it's a dark chapter of the guild's history and there was a large divide in philosophy.\" \r\nIf asked what it means to be in the Fighters Guild: \"That's a good question, one I don't hear often enough from the other members in our hall. The Fighters Guild is here to serve those who need our help. If their coin is good enough, their fights become our fights, and we'll take our steel to their enemies. But it's more than that. I don't think I can explain it to you unless you see it for yourself. It's that look in a husband's eyes when you bring his wife back into his arms. Being able to help the people of Cyrodiil, to change their lives for the better, is what this is all about.\" \r\nIf complimented on her passion: \"I just wish my underlings shared that passion.\"\r\nIf asked about poor citizens: \"Well... then we don't help them. It's not a flawless system. Nothing is without its faults, but... I just wish there was something more I could do. I suppose that's life, right? At least we can help some of them. It's just a shame those who need our help the most probably can't afford it.\" \r\n\"I try to do what I can aside of guild affairs, but it's a tender topic with the city guard.\" \r\nIf asked what she does at the guild hall: \"I lead this hall. It's my task to make sure it's up to the standards set by Master Coltinius and Champion Cyrus. It's also my responsibility to try and control Eranir and Ionalla - a monumental calling, believe me.\" \r\nIf asked what she does in her free time: \"I like to train myself and others in the use of two handed weaponry. I find conditioning my body to be therapeutic. I must be strong for the time when my skills are needed the most.\" \r\nIf asked about Eranir and Ionalla: \"Oh, they get along like a log cabin set ablaze! The only problem is the result is just as devastating... They can be quite the handful, let's say. Especially when they're intoxicated.\"",
