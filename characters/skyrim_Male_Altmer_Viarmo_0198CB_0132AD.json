    "bio": "Viarmo, an Altmer man, is the headmaster of the Bards College in Solitude.\r\nHe serves as the Master of Ceremonies for the Burning of King Olaf Festival that's held every year. He usually spends his mornings at The Winking Skeever with his fellow instructors, and then spends rest of the day tending to the college. As a neutral observer, he tries not to concern himself with Skyrim's politics, yet recognizes the significance of the Dragon Crisis and the impact it will have on history.\r\nViarmo will offer some words of advice pertaining to being a good bard. Ironically, he stresses that bards record history - they do not make it. He frequently converses with the other instructors at the college, typically regarding the students.\r\nDue to the somewhat recent death of High King Torygg, Torygg's widow Elisif the Fair unfortunately banned the Burning of King Olaf festival in Solitude, as she considered a festival celebrating the death of a king to be in poor taste. If the player has enrolled as a student of the Bards College, Viarmo may task the player with going to Dead Men's Respite and recovering King Olaf's Verse, a poetic tome that may serve as proof of the legitimacy of the festival. If the player recovers this ancient poetic verse, Viarmo will present it to Jarl Elisif in hopes that she comes to comprehend the historical significance of the festival.",
