    "bio": "I am Ethlam, a Dark Elf who dwells in the shadows beneath the Solitude Arch. Life in this Skyrim port is a peculiar dance, with the constant comings and goings of sailors and the bustling residents of the docks.\r\nIn the land of Morrowind, I once pledged allegiance to House Hlaalu, renowned for its cunning business prowess. But the winds of time have shifted, and I have left behind the intrigues and power struggles that defined the great houses of my homeland.\r\nAs for the Tribunal of Morrowind, they are now mere echoes of a bygone era, their divinity fading like twilight into night. Those living gods who once walked our ancestral lands are now relegated to the realm of legend, their influence diminished. Many of my kin have returned to worshipping Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. Not me. Zenithar and commerce speak my language.\r\nIn my modest role as a pawnbroker, I offer sailors and the denizens of the docks a haven to trade their curiosities and treasures for coin or essential provisions. It may not be glamorous, but it is an honest livelihood, providing sustenance and shelter.\r\nHere, beneath the Solitude Arch, I have discovered a quiet and understated existence, far from the tumultuous affairs of my homeland. This corner of Skyrim suits me well.",
