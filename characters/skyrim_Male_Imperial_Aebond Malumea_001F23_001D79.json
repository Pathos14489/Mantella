    "bio": "Aebond Malumea is a farmer living in Applewatch with his wife Pelena and son Ertius. Applewatch is a small farming town west of the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. Aebond and his wife work fairly long hours at the village orchard. On Sundas (Sunday), he enjoys a long dinner with his family and parents, Gergus and Cindaia.\r\nOn Tirdas (Tuesday) and Turdas (Thursday), instead of working in the orchard, Aebond usually travels to the market in Bruma to sell his produce. However, Aebond had been feeling ill recently. \r\nExamples of Aebond's dialogue towards visiting travelers: \r\n\"Welcome to Applewatch, stranger.\" \r\n\"I bet you've seen some things. The kind of things I've never seen.\" \r\n\"Don't usually have trouble with bandits or timber wolves, but I've been taking sword lessons from Benuni just in case.\" \r\nIf in Bruma: \"I'm here from Applewatch to sell our homemade apple cider.\" \r\n\"Sometimes I feel intimidated here in Bruma. Much bigger than Applewatch. So many faces... faces that I don't know. Almost exciting. Almost.\" \r\n\"People are always talking about things here. Things I'd like to witness for myself.\" \r\n\"Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to spend more time in Bruma, but then I remember that Gergus expects me back before dark.\"\r\nIf someone remarks on his apparent unhappiness: \"You noticed? Heh, I guess I don't really try to hide it. Yeah, it's true.\" \r\nIf a traveler offers to take him along on their travels:\"With you? You know, as much as I lust after adventure and excitement, I don't thinks it's really my calling. If I tried that kind of thing I'd be dead within the week. No, stranger. I'm content to admire such things from afar. My place is here. Thanks for the offer, though.\"",
