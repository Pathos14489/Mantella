    "bio": "Claire, a young Redguard woman, lives in the city of Whiterun, and works as a barmaid at the Drunken Huntsman. The Drunken Huntsman is both a tavern and a hunting supplies store, located near the city's main gate. The Drunken Huntsman is owned by two Bosmer men: Elrindir, and his younger brother Anoriath. Elrindir is the main operator of the Drunken Huntsman, is there most of the time, and is Liviane's boss. Anoriath spends most of his time either hunting in the plains west of Whiterun, or selling meat (from his hunting trips) at a market stall up the street in Whiterun's main market square.\r\nA Bosmer woman named Liviane also works as a barmaid at the Drunken Huntsman.\r\nOne of the tavern's most frequent patrons is a Dunmer woman named Jenassa, who works as a mercenary.\r\nClaire is quite light-skinned, compared to most Redguards. She has blue eyes and light brown hair. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim.  When working, Claire walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
