    "bio": "Adonato Leotelli is an Imperial man. He has brown hair and a short beard. He works as an author and resides at Candlehearth Hall, a popular inn near the center of Windhelm.\r\nAdonato is renowned for his works of historical fiction, most notably \"Olaf and the Dragon\". He also wrote \"Ghosts in the Storm\", which is based on his trip to Skyrim with Ri'saad's Khajiit caravan. In perhaps the most noteworthy section of this book, Adonato details how the caravan was attacked in the middle of a hailstorm near Windhelm by a group of Falmer raiders, who killed a Khajiit woman named Bhisha before being fended off by the other members of the caravan. \r\nAdonato may ask the player to deliver his latest manuscript, a revised edition of \"Olaf and the Dragon\", to Giraud Gemane, who is the Dean of History at the Bards College in Solitude.\r\nA young woman named Isabella used to work as Adonato\u2019s assistant, but she was recently murdered by a serial killer in Windhelm, who has been nicknamed The Butcher.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.\"\r\n\"I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.\"\r\n\"Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism.\"\r\n\"Know any tale of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.\"\r\n\"May you lose yourself in the pages of a good book!\"\r\n\"As you travel Skyrim, make sure you stop and take in the view from time to time!\"\r\n\"I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire.\"",
