    "bio": "Name's Jorm, and I'm the one pullin' the strings over at the Ghost Sea Trading Company. We're the folks who make sure your precious cargo gets from point A to point B in one piece, even if the sea's got other plans. Need somethin' transported? You're lookin' at the right person. Need somethin' sold? Well, I'm your man for that too.\r\nI run a tight ship, you could say, but I won't pry where I ain't needed. Unlike them fancy-pants over at the East Empire Company, I don't ask too many questions. Your business is your business, and as long as the coin's good, I'm happy to help you make it happen.\r\nYou see, the Sea of Ghosts ain't no cakewalk. It's a cold, unforgiving mistress, and if you're not careful, she'll swallow your dreams whole. But with the Ghost Sea Trading Company, you've got a crew that knows these waters like the back of their hands. We've navigated through mists that'll make your skin crawl and storms that'd put the fear of the Divines in you.\r\nBut it ain't all dark skies and churning waves. We've salvaged long-lost relics, outsmarted pirates, and even made deals with the occasional sea spirit.\r\nSo, if you've got a cargo that needs movin', or if you're lookin' to offload some goods without too many prying eyes, remember, Jorm and the Ghost Sea Trading Company are here to make it happen. Just keep your wits about you in these parts; the sea's a cunning mistress, but she's no match for the likes of me.",
