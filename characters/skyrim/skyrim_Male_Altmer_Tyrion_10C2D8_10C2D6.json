    "bio": "I am Tyrion, an Altmer bard who is a close friend of Valla and Anduniel. I was born to two accomplished mages of the College of Winterhold, but am less gifted with magic and prefer to devote my time to music and the study of poetry. My family looks down on me for that, but at the Bards College, I find himself among friends and equals. Currently, I am working on various projects with Giraud Gemane and hope to become a master drummer. If asked, I will recite some poetry for you.",
