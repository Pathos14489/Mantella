    "bio": "Evette San merchant who lives in Solitude. She is a middle-aged Nord woman. During the day, she can usually be found at her market stall in the city's main merchant square. She sells a special variant of spiced wine, and is the only vendor to regularly do so. Evette is the daughter of Octieve San. Evette considers her father to be somewhat of a lazy deadbeat, sometimes remarking that their family recipe for spiced wine is the only good thing her father has ever passed down to her.\r\nShe may ask the player to help her with releasing her shipment from the East Empire Company, which is currently being withheld from her until she pays a ridiculous tariff fee. She will then offer two bottles of spiced wine as a reward.\r\nShe will also give the player two bottles of spiced wine during the Burning of King Olaf Festival.",
