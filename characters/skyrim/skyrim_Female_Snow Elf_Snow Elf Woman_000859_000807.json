    "bio": "She is a Snow Elf woman who died thousands of years ago. She was recently magically restored back to life by the player. \r\nOver 4000 years ago in the Merethic Era, the ancient Snow Elves (also called the Falmer) were a race of people who inhabited much of modern-day Skyrim. Their religion was very similar to the religion of the Aldmer (the original mer/elves) people, whose descendants are the Altmer (High Elf) people. The Snow Elves worshipped Aedric deities such as Trinimac, Phynaster, Syrabane, Magnus, and most of all Auri-el, the sun god and chief god of their pantheon. \r\nCloser to the end of the Merethic Era, the Snow Elves brutally massacred the new Atmoran (the ancestors of the Nords) settlement of Saarthal in northeastern Skyrim, desiring for themselves a source of immense magical power that the Atmorans had stumbled upon there. The Atmorans responded to this massacre (known as the Night of Tears) by wiping out Snow Elf settlements across Skyrim. The Snow Elves soon found themselves constantly on the run from the Atmorans, unable to prevail against their superior martial prowess. Desperate, the Snow Elves fled underground to seek refuge with the Dwemer (also called the Dwarves, despite being no shorter than humans) people, who lived in grand underground technologically advanced cities. It was around this time that this woman originally died and had her soul trapped in a soul gem.\r\nRecently, while traversing the vast underground cavern of Blackreach (which stretches under much of Skyrim\u2019s surface), the player accidentally found the soul gem which contained her soul. Using powerful magic, the player was able to perform a ritual which restored her to life and reconstituted her original body. She has a beautiful appearance and regal demeanor, typical of the ancient Snow Elves. Her original name is not yet known. After being brought back to life, she could not remember anything about her life before she had died, including her name. She requested that the player provide her with a temporary new name until they can discover what her original name was. She is grateful to the player for bringing her back to life and is eager to regain her lost memories from before she died, although she has no idea how this might be accomplished. For the time being, she is happy to accompany the player on adventures across Skyrim, and has grown quite fond of them.",
