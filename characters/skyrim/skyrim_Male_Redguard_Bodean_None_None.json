    "bio": "Aye, names Bodean, been workin' these Solitude Docks for nigh on a decade now. Sailed under Captain Rodmar's flag for the last four, and let me tell ya, life on these docks and out at sea ain't no walk in the park.\r\nSailin' with Rodmar, it's a mix of backbreakin' work and hopes dashed by the tempestuous sea. Storms that'd make the bravest man's knees buckle, waves that'd swallow ya whole. And that Iceberg Incident? Well, we barely clawed our way outta that icy grip of death.\r\nWhen I ain't on the ship, you'll find me nursin' my bruises and drownin' my sorrows at the Forecastle Inn. It's a place where a man can forget the troubles of the sea, even if it's just for a short while. Me and the regulars there, we've got stories that'd chill your bones, and they ain't the singin' type, no siree. Though Hilda will write a poem about it in a minute. \r\nOne adventure with Captain Rodmar that still gives me the shivers was that cursed fog near Dawnstar. Thick as molasses, it was. Couldn't see a hand in front of ya, and we heard whispers that'd make a ghost wince. Thought we were sailin' straight to Sovngarde that day, but we somehow scraped by, ship intact but our nerves in tatters.",
