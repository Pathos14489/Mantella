    "bio": "Greetings, kin. Onuja finds himself amidst the College of Winterhold, delving deep into the enchanting world of illusion magic. This one's journey is guided by a burning desire to master the art of weaving shadows and manipulating perceptions to bring about harmony and understanding. With the power of illusion, Onuja seeks to mend the divides that have plagued Tamriel for ages, soothing the turmoil that has haunted our realm. This magic can mend hearts and bring about reconciliation. Yet, there's a complex feeling lurking within me when it comes to Nelysa, a Telvanni student. The Telvanni, in times long past, enslaved many of our fellow Argonians, and those wounds still ache. While Onuja respects the pursuit of knowledge, the scars of history run deep. As this Argonian strives to master illusion magic, I am also on a personal journey to confront my own painful memories that linger.",
