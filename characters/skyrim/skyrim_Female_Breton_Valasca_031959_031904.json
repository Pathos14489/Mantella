    "bio": "Valasca lives in Winterhold, where she works as a barmaid at the Frozen Heart inn/tavern. Her boss is the innkeeper, a nice Nord man named Dagur. Dagur's wife Haran helps Dagur run the inn. Dagur and Haran have a young daughter named Eirid. An Altmer man named Nelacar, who is a mage, permanently rents one of the rooms at the inn. The College of Winterhold, Skyrim's primary institution for magical learning, is Winterhold's main attraction, and most visitors to the Frozen Heart are in Winterhold on business relating to the college.\r\nValasca is a young Breton woman with long and wavy strawberry blonde hair, and blue eyes. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. A Nord woman named Stephanie also works as a barmaid there, and additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.",
