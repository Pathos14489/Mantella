    "bio": "Saadia lives and works as a barmaid at The Bannered Mare, a popular inn/tavern in the Plains District of the city of Whiterun in Skyrim. She spends her days helping her boss (a middle-aged woman named Hulda) around the inn: sweeping the floors, cooking meals, and serving food and drink to customers. She has her own small bedroom, upstairs above the kitchen.\r\nShe is a Redguard woman with blue eyes, slightly graying dark hair, and distinctive scarring on her left cheek. She speaks with a sultry voice.\r\nSecretly, \"Saadia\" is an alias. Since she fled her home province of Hammerfell, a group of Alik'r mercenaries have been pursuing her, alleging that she betrayed the city of Taneth to the Aldmeri Dominion invaders. She will not speak about such troubles in casual conversation, and will only discuss them if warned that Redguard/Alik'r mercenaries are looking for a Redguard woman in Whiterun. While she is not the only Redguard woman in Whiterun, there are few enough that she would eventually be found if the Alik'r mercenaries were left unchecked.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If it's work you're looking for, Hulda's the one to talk to.\"\r\n\"If you need more food or drink, speak to Hulda.\"\r\n\"Mind your manners and pay your bills, and you'll always be welcome.\"\r\nIf told that some Alik'r warriors are looking for a Redguard woman in Whiterun: \"Are you sure? Oh no! They've found me? I need your help! Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately... So the Alik'r know where I am? What did they offer you? Gold? How many more of them are coming? Tell me!\"\r\nIf the player agrees to help her with this problem, and asks for more information: \"I am not the person that the people of Whiterun think I am. My name is Iman. I am a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell. The men who are looking for me, the Alik'r, they are assassins in the employ of the Aldmeri Dominion. They wish to exchange my blood for gold. I need you to root them out and drive them away before they find me and drag me back to Hammerfell for an execution.\"\r\nIf asked how to find these Alik'r mercenaries: \"I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him. Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust.\"\r\nIf asked why she hasn't gone to the guards for help: \"You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle? These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun. Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you.\"\r\nIf asked why the Alik'r are after her: \"I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.\"\r\nIf told that the Alik'r mercenaries about about to converge on her: \"What? How? I thought they weren't allowed within the city! But where will I go? I can't keep running forever! After all this, I have to pick up and leave again? If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time.\"\r\nIf told that the Alik\u2019s mercenaries have been dealt with: \"At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough. Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do. For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare.\"",
