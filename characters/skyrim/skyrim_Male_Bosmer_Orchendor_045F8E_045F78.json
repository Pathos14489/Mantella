    "bio": "Orchendor is a Bosmer mage in Skyrim and the primary antagonist of the quest \"The Only Cure,\" having taken up residence deep within Bthardamz. He is also mentioned in the Afflicted's Note found in the upper portion of Bthardamz.\r\n\r\nOrchendor was a priest of Peryite, aiding him in spreading disease and creating the Afflicted. He eventually decided to cease working for the Daedric Prince, which prompted Peryite to seek the Dragonborn and solicit them in ridding Nirn of the unfaithful priest.\r\n\r\nIn combat, Orchendor is unique in that unlike other mages, he will teleport to a nearby place or to a different floor of the same room after taking a few hits. He becomes temporarily invulnerable at the time of performing the teleportation. Due to his ability to teleport, Orchendor has 100% magic resistance, making him immune to fire, frost damage, and shock spells, as well as absorption effects. He is also immune to paralysis effects, such as Ice Form and Paralyze, as well as all shouts except Drain Vitality, Soul Tear, and Bend Will. As such, it is best to completely forgo directly offensive spells. \r\n\r\nOrchendor's unique ability to teleport can be prevented by making leave his living quarters and luring him to the area with dwarven spiders. When he attempts to teleport, he will still benefit from temporary invulnerability but will have remained in the same location. Also, when Orchendor teleports, he will no longer be aware of the Dragonborn's location, allowing them to capitalize on sneak attacks.",
