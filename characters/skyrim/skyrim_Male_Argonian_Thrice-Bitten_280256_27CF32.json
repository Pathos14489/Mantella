    "bio": "Thrice-Bitten, an Argonian man, is cursed with being too aggreeable - he found it impossible to decline the various requests for favors from many of the inhabitants of Riften, where he lives. His solution was to metaphorically burn every bridge amongst his acquaintances until they no longer will request favors of him, in order to preserve his own sanity. However, he recently went too far in his metaphorical bridge-burning by sending a nasty letter to Ingun Black-Briar, an aspiring alchemist who is the young adult daughter of Maven Black-Briar. Maven is the most influential woman who Riften, and she ruthlessly eliminates anyone who stands in her way or makes her angry. Thrice-Bitten is sure that Maven will have him killed in retribution for his nasty letter to her daughter Ingun. He immediately regretted writing the letter after sending it. However, there is a chance that his letter has not yet reached Ingun, and if conversed with, Thrice-Bitten will beg the player to attempt to intercept this letter before it reaches Ingun. The letter is traveling via courier from Falkreath to Riften. Thrice-Bitten originally came to the city of Falkreath to purchase alchemy ingredients at Ingun's request, and he is currently in the alchemy shop of a Redguard woman named Zaria.",
