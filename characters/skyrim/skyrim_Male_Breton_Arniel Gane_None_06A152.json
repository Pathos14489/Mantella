    "bio": "Arniel Gane, a Breton man, is a senior member of the College of Winterhold. He is a researcher of peculiar magics and history. He is a capable mage, and wears a set of adept-level Alteration magic robes. He is bald-headed and clean shaven. His living quarters are on the second floor of the Hall of Attainment.\r\nArniel leads an archaeological excavation at the ancient Nordic crypt of Saarthal.\r\nArniel secretly hopes to acquire and experiment with the ancient 3 ancient Dwemer artifacts collectively known as Kagrenac's tools, which are named Keening, Sunder, and Wraithguard.\r\nAs part of a secret experiment, Arniel will task the player with retrieving ten Dwemer Cogs. After finding the artifacts, he will then ask the player to contact Enthir about a warped soul gem that Arniel wants from him. After the player retrieves the warped soul gem, Arniel will teach the player to use a spell called Arniel\u2019s Convection to heat the warped soul gem after it has been placed in a Dwemer Convector, which must be done 3 times in 3 separate Dwemer Convectors.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.\"\r\n\"Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.\"\r\n\"I'm working on some very important research, I assure you.\"\r\n\"The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable.\"\r\n\"When I've finished what I'm working on, everyone will understand its significance.\"\r\n\u201cIt may not be \"official\", but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on. I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.\"\r\nIf the player delivers Keening to Arniel: \u201cKeening, one of the great tools of Kagrenac himself, is finally in my possession. I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.\"",
