    "bio": "Lundvar serves as a guard in the city of Markarth. He recently lost his brother under suspicious circumstances. Much of his dialogue alludes to the corruption that plagues the city. Lundvar lauds the Nords' unbreakable system of honor. He is blind in one eye, as a result of relying on a culinary potion developed by Clario Moorsley, an exotic chef who works at Understone Keep, the jarl's palace in Markarth.",
