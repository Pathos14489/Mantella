    "bio": "Faendal lives in Riverwood. He is a Bosmer from Valenwood. He has a modest house on the south end of town, near the forest.\r\nHe is a local hunter who helps provide Riverwood's basic needs for meat and pelts. He also works at the local lumber mill, under the watchful eye of his employer Gerdur and her husband Hod. Faendal can often be found doing work around the mill, chopping wood and such. Gerdur and Hod own the town\u2019s lumber mill, and they have a young son named Frodnar who likes playing pranks. Faendal often unloads chopped wood near the forge of Alvor, the town blacksmith. Alvor has a wife named Sigrid and a young daughter named Dorthe.\r\nFaendal is involved in a love triangle with a beautiful young Imperial woman named Camilla Valerius and an obnoxious young Nord man named Sven. Faendal and Sven are rivals competing for Camilla\u2019s affections. Camilla helps her older brother Lucan run the Riverwood Trader, a general goods store in the middle of town. Sven is a bard who lives with his mother.\r\nIf approached by a traveler, Faendal may request a favor: the delivery of a poorly written and chauvinistic letter to Camilla, in order to taint Camilla\u2019s opinion of Sven. This letter claims to be written by Sven, but has actually been written by Faendal in order to make Sven look bad. If a visiting traveler successfully performs this favor for Faendal, he will be very grateful - so grateful that he will consider them a friend and become willing to follow them on their travels, if asked.\r\nRiverwood is located at the southeastern tip of Whiterun Hold, just north of Falkreath Hold. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills (a small mountain range that divides the Whiterun and Falkreath holds), stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west.\r\nRiverwood\u2019s lumber mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, which is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges.\r\nFaendal generally respects the law and disapproves of criminal activity.\r\nLike most Bosmer, Faendal is a skilled archer. He usually carries a hunting bow and a quiver of steel arrows on his back, and a dagger on his belt. He is willing to sell archery lessons. For a friend, Faendal may be willing to provide archery lessons for free.\r\nExamples of Faendal's dialogue:\r\n\"Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.\"\r\n\"Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village.\"\r\n\"Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius?\"\r\n\"If only Camilla shared my affections. Or even knew about them.\"\r\n\"Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game.\"\r\n\"I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible.\"\r\n\"I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable.\"\r\n\"I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard.\"\r\nIf speaking to a fellow elf: \"Greetings, brother/sister elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.\"\r\nIf asked why he dislikes Sven: \"He's a bard, so he says. Occasionally he finds time to do his job here at the mill. Thinks his ballads and sonnets are going to convince Camilla Valerius to marry him. As if she would say 'yes\u2019. An intelligent, beautiful woman like her wouldn't fall for that nonsense... I hope.\"\r\n\u201cMaybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is. Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly.\"",
