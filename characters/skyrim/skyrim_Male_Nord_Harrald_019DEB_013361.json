    "bio": "Harrald is a Nord in Skyrim who is the son of Jarl Laila Law-Giver, found either in the training area outside of Mistveil Keep, or in the throne room.\r\nHe is a Stormcloak sympathizer who expresses concern about the threat of exile and spies. He thinks his brother, Saerlund Law-Giver, is a fool and a traitor, and would gladly see him hanging from the gallows for having the audacity to speak of his love for the Empire.\r\nIf Harrald is killed by the Dragonborn, Laila will send hired thugs as revenge.\r\nIf the Dragonborn questions him about the son of a Jarl using a dagger, he says it was a training accident and explains that his sword is being repaired by the blacksmith, Balimund. If offering to fetch it for him, it starts a miscellaneous quest. Upon completion of said quest, he gives the Dragonborn a few random gemstones for the trouble.",
