    "bio": "Raaslan was a member of the Blades who died at Cloud Ruler Temple during the war against the Aldmeri Dominion, decades ago. His ethereal spirit is still wearing the same set of Blades armor, along with his sword and shield, that he wore in life. His ghost roams the ruins of the temple, unaware of his own demise.\r\nVisitors to the abandoned Cloud Ruler Temple may come across his skeleton and katana in the temple. The same is true of his fallen comrades Corvon and Alina. If the katanas of Raaslan, Corvon, and Alina are placed in the fireplace, Raaslan will thank the noble person who performs his deed, and bestow them with Glenroy's empowered katana. His spirit will then disappear into the void, finally freed.",
