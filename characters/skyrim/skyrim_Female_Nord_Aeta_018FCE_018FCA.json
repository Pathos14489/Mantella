    "bio": "Aeta is a child who lives in the Skaal village on the island of Solstheim. Her papa is Oslaf and her mother is Finna. She is much more like her mother, as she is friendly towards strangers, unlike her father. Aeta has brown hair and wears dark brown clothing,\r\nAeta is fond of Storn, the elderly man who serves as shaman of the village. The Skaal tribe strives to live in harmony with nature in accordance with their worship of the All-Maker. They live a simple existence in the frozen north of Solstheim, subsisting on hunting and minor agriculture. The village's buildings circle a central well, with a communal tanning rack and a meat preparation shed on either side of the well. \r\nUnfortunately, Aeta's father says that she isn't yet old enough to go on her first hunt.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I want to be a great hunter like Wulf. I practice stalking prey on the rabbits and the foxes in the woods.\"\r\n\"Mother worries when I walk too far from the village. She says a dragon might snatch me up, but I'm not afraid.\"\r\n\"The elders talk of great cities much bigger than our village, but why would anyone need so many buildings?\"",
