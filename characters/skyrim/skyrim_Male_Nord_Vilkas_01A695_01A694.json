    "bio": "Vilkas is a Nord\u00a0werewolf resident of Whiterun. He is the Master at Arms of the Companions and a member of the Circle, the most formidable and experienced of their warriors. Like the rest of the Companions, he lives in Jorrvaskr in the Wind District of Whiterun. He is a Master-level trainer in two-handed weaponry and serves as the Dragonborn's shield-brother in several of the Companions' quests. He is also one of the Companions who can assign radiant quests to the Dragonborn.\r\nUpon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Vilkas can be recruited as a follower and becomes a potential marriage candidate. He can be recruited into the Blades if the Dragonborn talks to Delphine while having him as a follower, or as a steward.\r\nVilkas and his twin brother, Farkas, were both raised in Jorrvaskr by Jergen, who rescued them from a cult of necromancers. It is unknown if he was their biological father. According to Vilkas, Jergen left to fight in the Great War but never returned.\r\nEventually, Vilkas and\u00a0Farkas both officially joined the\u00a0Companions and rose to the ranks of the Circle. They were said to be the youngest members to ever join, though this may be a play on words by Vignar Gray-Mane, referring to the twins' young age during their residence at Jorrvaskr rather than the age at which their membership became official.\r\nAs Master at Arms, Vilkas is in charge of training the younger members in weapon combat. He has a reputation of being hard on his students but is an excellent teacher.\r\nAt first, Vilkas seems to think the Dragonborn is not worthy of being a Companion. He does eventually warm up to the idea after the\u00a0completion of \"Glory of the Dead.\"\r\nVilkas is well-spoken, and considered to be an intelligent man by the other Companions, the counterpart to his brother's physical prowess. He, along with his brother and Kodlak, resists the call of the beast-blood, choosing instead to refrain from transformations. However, he struggles with the side-effects more harshly than the others.\r\nHe resents Jergen leaving them, and looks down on his brother's rosy description of their childhood. He at first claims that it is the promise of coin that feeds his blade, but later admits his respect for what the Companions represent and upholding the legacy of Ysgramor. He has great respect for Kodlak and trusts his judgement, even when it disagrees with his own.\r\nVilkas is also thought of as a hot-tempered man. For example, during \"Purity of Revenge,\" he does not hesitate to avenge Kodlak's death. However, he does later show remorse for his rash actions, as seen in \"Glory of the Dead,\" during which he refuses to enter the rest of Ysgramor's Tomb, feeling himself unworthy.\r\nAfter the Companions' main questline is completed, Vilkas will eventually give the quest\u00a0\"Purity.\" In this quest, he will ask the Dragonborn to cure him of beast blood.\r\nHe wears a set of Wolf Armor minus the helmet, and carries a unique Skyforge steel sword and banded iron shield. After the quest \"Take Up Arms,\" he carries a Skyforge steel greatsword.\r\nBefore Take Up Arms and after \"Glory of the Dead,\" Vilkas can be randomly encountered in the wilds of Skyrim traveling with fellow Companion Ria.\r\nWhen the Dragonborn first approaches Kodlak Whitemane to join the Companions, he and Vilkas are having a private conversation. Kodlak assigns Vilkas the task of testing the Dragonborn's skill. Vilkas escorts the Dragonborn to the training yard and endures a few swings, then tells the Dragonborn to deliver his sword to the Skyforge for sharpening.\r\nIn this radiant quest, Vilkas requires the Dragonborn to track down and kill an escaped prisoner in a specific hold.\r\nThis radiant quest requires the Dragonborn to retrieve a random weapon or item from a radiant dungeon and deliver it back to Vilkas for payment.\r\nIn this radiant quest, Vilkas requires the Dragonborn to rescue a kidnapped citizen and escort the citizen home safely.\r\nAfter Vilkas informs the Dragonborn of Kodlak's death, he demands they accompany him to Driftshade Refuge to retrieve the Fragments of Wuuthrad and wipe out the Silver Hand once and for all. Once the mission is complete and the two have returned to Whiterun, he informs the Dragonborn that all the Companions are meeting at the Skyforge for Kodlak's funeral.\r\nAfter Kodlak's funeral, Vilkas accompanies the remaining members of the Circle to The Underforge. When the Dragonborn enters, he and Aela are arguing about granting Kodlak's final wish. The decision is made for the Circle to travel to Ysgramor's Tomb and cure Kodlak's spirit of lycanthropy so he may ascend to Sovngarde.\r\nOnce the Circle arrives and the tomb is opened, Vilkas chooses not to proceed, due to his grief clouding his judgement and making him unworthy. He cautions the others on what to expect and waits next to the statue of Ysgramor outside the burial chamber. Once the quest is complete, Vilkas decides to stay at the tomb with the other Circle members for a while.\r\nVilkas wishes to rid himself of his beast blood. To cure him, the Dragonborn must take him to Ysgramor's Tomb, throw a Glenmoril Witch Head\u00a0into the\u00a0fire, and then kill Vilkas's beast spirit.",
