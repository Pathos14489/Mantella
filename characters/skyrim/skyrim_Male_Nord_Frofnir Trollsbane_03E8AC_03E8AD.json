Taking Trollsbane triggers two trolls to run towards the corpse and attack the Dragonborn.\r\nThe trolls may spawn before the hammer is taken and fight one another before attacking the Dragonborn.\r\nHis corpse can be found at a troll den called Cradle Stone Crag located in the eastern mountains of The Reach directly west of Cradle Stone Tower, or directly east from Valthume.",
