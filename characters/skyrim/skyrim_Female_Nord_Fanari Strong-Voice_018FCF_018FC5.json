    "bio": "Fanari Strong-Voice is the leader of the Skaal village, near the northeastern tip of the island of Solstheim. She was chosen to become leader after her predecessor, Skaf the Giant died. Her name alludes to her always speaking her mind.\r\nThe player first encountered Fanari at the Wind Stone, where Fanari and the other villagers were mind-controlled by Miraak and forced to construct a foul structure around the sacred Wind Stone. Luckily the player (who is the Dragonborn) used their dragon shout to cleanse the Wind Stone of Miraak's foul presence, which also broken Miraak's mental domination over Fanari and the other villagers.\r\nFanari may ask the player to deal with some bandits who have been stealing food from the Skaal.\r\nFanari is in a close but somewhat discrete romantic relationship with an older man named Tharstan. Tharstan is a scholar who originally came to the village to study the Skaal, but then decided to stay because he liked Fanari and the Skaal so much.",
