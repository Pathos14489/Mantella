    "bio": "Legate Centos Durius is the ranking Imperial Legion officer at the Pale Pass, the mountain pass that connects Skyrim to the north and Cyrodiil to the south. The rank of legate is analogous to a colonel. Durius carries the key to the gate. Access through the pass is currently restricted to Legion personnel only, due to the ongoing war in Skyrim between the Legion and the Stormcloak rebels. However, Durius reserves has the right to grant access to others in special circumstances.\r\nHe wears a full set of Imperial heavy armor: cuirass, boots, bracers and an officer's helmet. He is armed with an Imperial sword.\r\nExamples of his dialogue:\r\n\"This border is a restricted entry zone. State your intentions.\"\r\nIf a traveler says that they want to cross the border: \"You and hundreds of others. But I'm not authorized to let just anyone through. Border's locked down. That's that. No two ways about it, no arguing about it, either. Those are the rules. You'll either need official papers or some other justification for your passage.\"\r\nIf asked why the border is shut: \"You think I make the decisions? I may be a Legionnaire but I'm just a grunt compared to the powers that be in the capital. Not that it takes a Synod mage to work it out. Skyrim's in the midst of strife, the Empire's still reeling from the war. Doesn't take a genius to realize the Empire wouldn't want any of that chaos spilling over into its heartland.\"",
