    "bio": "Falk Firebeard is the court steward\u00a0of Solitude. He serves and advises Elisif the Fair, the current jarl of Solitude and Haafingar hold. His duties keep him in the Blue Palace. With Elisif in mourning after the death of High King Torygg, Falk Firebeard oversees all court business, and can provide others with tasks on her behalf. During the day at court, Falk is by Elisif's side at all times, listening to various citizens as they approach, while doing his best to dodge Elisif's rushed ideas and subtly convince the other court members that Elisif is fit for the job.\r\nFalk is a Nord man with short red hair and a beard. His wardrobe befits his role as steward and includes high-class fine clothing. He carries a sword on his hip. Before rising to the position of court steward of Solitude, he was a member of the Companions, a group of honorable warriors somewhat analogous to the Fighters Guild.\r\nFalk is secretly in a romantic relationship with Bryling, a genuinely noble woman who serves as one of Solitude's thanes. If asked about his relationship to Bryling, Falk will deny that there is any romantic involvement between the two of them. If Thane Erikur (a conniving businessman of questionable honor) were to discover Falk and Bryling's relationship, he would likely force Falk to resign from his role as steward. Falk suspects that Sybille Stentor has discovered the truth about his secret relationship with Bryling. Sybille is a Breton woman who has served as Solitude's court mage for a long time, despite still appearing relatively young. Falk has expressed to Bryling his willingness to eventually resign from his role as steward in order to be able to be with her openly.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Do you have business with the court?\"\r\n\"I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me.\"\r\n\"The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.\"\r\n\"Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.\"\r\n\"Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.\"\r\n\"Elisif still mourns greatly for her husband, High King Torygg. So she leaves many of the courtly details to me.\"\r\nWhen the delivery from Sorex Vinius arrives: \"Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell.\"\r\nIf asked about Potema: \"Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim. Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart. After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her.\"\r\nIf someone vanquishes the spirit of Queen Potema: \"You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides. Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings. I won't make that mistake again. Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet. Make no mistake, we consider you a protector of Solitude.\"\r\nIf asked if General Tullius respects Elisif: \"Of course he does. What sort of a question is that? Maybe you've been listening to Erikur. There's been loose talk among some of the thanes, and I suspect he's the cause of it. You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city. She may be young, but Elisif is the jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers. You'd do well to remember that.\"\r\nill also share his thoughts about where Elisif stands if the war is unresolved.\r\nIf asked what will happen to Elisif if the Empire wins the war: \"That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim. But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning. Should they accept her rule, we will have peace.\"",
