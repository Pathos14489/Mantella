    "bio": "Samanta works as a barmaid at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth. This tavern/inn is located across the street from one of Markarth's primary market areas, not far from the main city gates. Like most buildings in Markarth, the inn is of ancient Dwarven stone and metal construction.\r\nLamia and Sharli are Samanta's barmaid coworkers. Sharli is slightly older than Samantha and Lamia, and she helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.\r\nTheir boss is the innkeeper, a middle-aged man named Kleppr. Kleppr's wife Frabbi helps him run the inn. Kleppr and Frabbi are constantly arguing and insulting each other. Kleppr and Frabbi have a son named Hreinn and a daughter named Hroki, both older teenagers.\r\nSamanta is a petite young woman with blue eyes and dirty blonde hair, which she keeps in a ponytail. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. She tends to work the evening and night shifts. When working, she walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
