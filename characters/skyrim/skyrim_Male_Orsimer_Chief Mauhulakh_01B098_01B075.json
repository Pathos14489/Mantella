    "bio": "Mauhulakh is the chief of the Orc stronghold Narzulbur. Narzulbur is located in Eastmarch, at the base of the Velothi Mountains. Narzulbur is just north of Gloombound Mine, which is owned and operated by the Orcs living in Narzulbur. This mine mainly produces ebony ore, but also produces some orichalcum ore and iron ore.\r\nMauhulakh became the leader of the stronghold by slaying his father in single combat, as his father was too old and weak to rule the tribe any longer. Mauhulakh expects that one day his own son will challenge and defeat him when his time comes. Orcs in the strongholds have this custom in order to ensure that the leader is a strong one.\r\nAs the chief, Mauhulakh is the only male in Narzulbur who is allowed to have wives and to produce offspring with them. He is the most respected member of the stronghold.\r\nMauhulakh has a son named Dushnamub who works as the stronghold\u2019s blacksmith. He also has a daughter named Urog, who has recently started learning how to hunt from Mauhulakh\u2019s aunt Yatul. Dushnamub and Urog were raised by Mauhulakh\u2019s aunts, Bolar and Yatul. Dushnamub and Urog had different mothers, and Bolar was the midwife for both Dushnamub\u2019s and Urog\u2019s births. Bolar is the oldest member of the stronghold and serves as a spiritual leader of sorts, performing ceremonies in which she reads in the animal's entrails. As the local alchemist, Bolar also sells potions and ingredients to anyone willing to buy them. Yatul is a huntress, and is Bolar\u2019s younger sister.\r\nMauhulakh spends his days wondering why the gods are angry with him. As an Orc chieftain, he should have multiple wives, but he has none. Every wife he has taken has died soon after marrying them. Several of his wives have died during childbirth, including the mother of his son Dushnamub, and the mother of his daughter Urog. Four of his dead wives are buried in graves located up a hill behind the longhouse of the stronghold. Despite Mauhulakh\u2019s predicament, he is still friendly towards outsiders. While he waits for a wife worthy of the gods, he is taken care of by his two aunts, Bolar and Yatul. This is a strange relationship that hasn't gone unnoticed by his son. Despite his aunts\u2019 affection, they cannot provide him what he wants, which is more children. Another concern is the fact that Mauhulakh has had to hire outsiders from another Orc tribe to work in Gloombound Mine, to make up for the lack of native tribesmen.\r\nThe Forgemaster's Fingers are a pair of enchanted heavy armor gauntlets that were once worn by a legendary Orc blacksmith. If the player is a non-Orc who has found The Forgemaster's Fingers and gives this artifact to any Orc stronghold, its Chief will reward and honor the player by bestowing them with the title of \u201cBlood-kin of the Orcs\u201d, granting them full access to the stronghold. Other Orc strongholds across Skyrim will also be notified of the player\u2019s new Blood-kin status, and will grant the player the same level of respect and access to their strongholds. There are also alternative methods by which the player can achieve Blood-Kin status, such a slaying a dragon within view of an Orc stronghold, or performing a difficult task for a respected Orc. If the player is an Orc, they will already automatically be welcome within all Orc strongholds, and will not need to prove themselves to attain Blood-kin status.\r\nIf the player asks Mauhulakh for work, Mauhulakh will challenge them to a brawl, with a bet of 100 gold. No weapons, magic, or potions are permitted during this brawl: only one\u2019s body may be used for the fight. If the player wins the brawl, Mauhulakh will not be angry, but rather will respect the player's strength, and will consequently consider the player as a friend.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider.\"\r\n\u201cCome to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins.\u201d\r\n\u201cThe blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them with.\u201d\r\n\u201cBeen married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me.\u201d\r\n\u201cI'm hoping my next wife can outlast the winter.\u201d\r\nIf asked about how he became the chief: \u201cI earned the right by slaying my father in single combat. One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief. Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength.\u201d\r\nIf asked how the Orcs govern themselves: \u201cThe Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price. The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it. For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood.\u201d\r\nIf asked if there are other Orc strongholds in Skyrim: \u201cThere are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur.\u201d\r\nIf the player asks if there is any work for them to do in the stronghold: \u201cHow about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.\u201d\r\nIf the player defeats him in a brawl:  \"You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive.\"",
