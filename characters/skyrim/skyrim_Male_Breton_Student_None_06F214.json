    "bio": "The Student is a Breton conjurer who can be found during a random encounter that can occur inside or near one of the main cities.\r\nOnce the Dragonborn's Restoration skill reaches 50, an encounter can occur between the Dragonborn and a student, who wishes to enter the College of Winterhold. He asks the Dragonborn to help him learn, to which they can respond either, \"Maybe some other time\" or \"Sure, I can teach you.\" When choosing to help, the student uses Firebolt. After several successful blocks with any ward, he will say, \"Thank you, I think I'm ready to join the College now.\"",
