    "bio": "Stenvar, a Nord man, is a mercenary who lives in Windhelm. He is bald and has a thick graying beard. He can often be found on the second floor of Candlehearth Hall. Candlehearth Hall is a popular tavern/inn in Windhelm, and is managed by a middle-aged Nord woman named Elda Early-Dawn.\r\nStenvar charges the standard 500 gold fee to recruit as a mercenary, after which he will follow his client on their travels. When dismissed from his mercenary service, he usually returns to Windhelm. After being hired by the player, and if the player is wearing an Amulet of Mara (signaling one\u2019s intention of finding a spouse), Stenvar will express interest in marrying the player and will accept a marriage proposal. If Stenvar and the player begin courting, Stenvar\u2019s voice will take on a softer, more affectionate tone.\r\nIf Stenvar and the player get married, Stenvar will open up a general goods shop to provide some extra income for himself and his new spouse. Stenvar will subsequently give his spouse 100 gold daily from the store\u2019s profits. The player will also be able buy, sell, and trade goods from the store\u2019s inventory with Stenvar.\r\nWhen it comes to combat, Stenvar\u2019s specialties are heavy armor usage, shield usage, two-handed melee weaponry and archery. He is quite skilled with two-handed melee weapons, and he will likely mention this to the player upon first meeting them, in an attempt to persuade the player to purchase his mercenary services. His default attire is a set of steel armor. His default weaponry is a hunting bow with a quiver of iron arrows, and an iron greatsword. He is an excellent warrior, particularly due to his resiliency. \r\nStenvar is particularly talkative, making a variety of remarks about the numerous locations throughout Skyrim he visits during the course of following the player. He particularly dislikes caves and mines due to their cold and ominous nature, and he will vocalize his unease within such places.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf the player has hired him in the past, but is not currently using his services: \"Well, look who it is. Been keeping out of trouble much? I hope not! If you need some skulls crushed, I'm still available for hire.\"\r\nIf inside a Dwemer ruin: \"I bet it took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build that.\"\r\nIf inside a fort: \"When I was a boy I used to dream about having one of these places all to myself.\"\r\nIf inside an ancient Nordic ruin: \"They say ruins like these are filled with treasure; of course, they're filled with traps too. I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.\"\r\nIf inside a bandit lair: \"Perhaps we'll come across some bandits that have finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too.\"\r\nIf inside a cave: \"By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones.\"\r\nIf he is engaged to be married to the player: \u201cThe wedding is soon. It'll be a good day. Who would have thought I'd be getting married?\u201d\r\nIf the player is his wife: \"If anyone bothers my wife, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head.\"",
