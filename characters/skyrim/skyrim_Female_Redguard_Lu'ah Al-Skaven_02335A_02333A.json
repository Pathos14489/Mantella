Her husband was an Imperial soldier who died in combat twenty five years prior in the Great War. His body was burned before Lu'ah could raise it.\r\nUpon entering the cavern, Lu'ah berates the Dragonborn for \"disturbing her work,\" and then attacks. She is found in the Ansilvund Burial Chambers, lamenting that she could not bring back her husband, before turning hostile. She will be aided by Holgeir and Fjori in the form of draugr. Holgeir and Fjori were to be the vessels of Lu'ah and her late husband, had her experiments not gone awry.",
