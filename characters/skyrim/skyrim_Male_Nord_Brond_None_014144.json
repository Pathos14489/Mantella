According to him, he is a skilled fighter and has been fighting for a long time.\r\nHe is Huki's friend, Edorfin's rival, and Liesl's foe.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I've been a lot of things in my life. Pit fighter's the one I'm best at.\"\r\n\"We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.\"\r\n\"I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.\"\r\n\"There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.\"\r\n\"Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me.\"\r\n\"Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.\"",
