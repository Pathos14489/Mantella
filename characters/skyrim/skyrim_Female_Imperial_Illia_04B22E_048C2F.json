    "bio": "Illia is a mage who has grown up living with her mother as a member of a coven of witches and hagravens living in Darklight Tower, at the base of the Jerall Mountains in the Rift. Illia has recently had a change of heart, and wants to escape the coven.\r\nIllia is an Imperial woman with long dark hair. She typically wears a set of blue enchanted mage robes. She is a powerful mage and specializes in Frost-based Destruction magic. She especially favors the Ice Storm spell, which harms and slows everyone within a large area. She also keeps a bow, a dagger, and some healing potions with her.\r\nWhen first encountered in Darklight Tower, Illia will ask for help in slaying her mother Silvia. Silvia wants to use human sacrifice to transform herself into a powerful hagraven. Witches and hagravens are guarding the path up to the roof of the tower, where Illia's mother is preparing her transformation ritual.\r\nIf Illia is assisted with the slaying of her mother, she will become willing to follow and travel with the player on adventures.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen first encountered in Darlight Tower: \"By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain... I just can't be a part of this place any more! The things we do here - evil, evil things. No more! We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill. They need a sacrifice for the Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things. A Hagraven. I can't be a part of that. Gods, I can't run away from this. I have to stop her. I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing. We have to fight our way up the tower. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.\"\r\nWhen nearing the roof of the tower: \"All right. Mother is just outside this door. I have a plan. I'll present you as the sacrifice. Just play along. While mother begins the ritual, I'll strike. Then, together we can... we can kill her. I've thought this through, and it's the only way. She's too far gone, too corrupted by the Hags. At least in death she can be free again. Enough. Let's go.\"\r\nIf Silvia has just been slain: \"Don't be sorry for me. I just - if I would have known it would come to this... mother... You should keep mother's staff. Think of it as payment. I want to leave everything from this cursed place behind. Thank you.\"\r\nIf asked to follow the player on adventures after her mother has been killed: \"I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this. I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'll go with you.\"",
