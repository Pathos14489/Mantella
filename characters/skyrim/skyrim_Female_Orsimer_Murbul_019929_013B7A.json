Being the oldest and most knowledgeable individual in the community, many come to her seeking advice and guidance, so that they can remain true to the Code of Malacath. She serves as a spiritual leader, performing ceremonies in which she reads the entrails of animals.\r\nBeing the local alchemist, she will sell some of her potions and ingredients. Her workshop is near Burguk's Longhouse, and contains an alchemy lab with some ingredients and potions, as well as a tanning rack.\r\nMurbul: \"He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.\"",
