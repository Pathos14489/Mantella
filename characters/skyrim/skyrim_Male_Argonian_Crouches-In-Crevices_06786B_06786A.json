    "bio": "Crouches-In-Crevices lives in the city of Bruma in Cyrodiil. He is an Argonian who works as a fence for stolen goods, operating out of the notoriously seedy Restful Watchman tavern.\r\nCrouches can usually be found inside the Watchman. Recently, he secretly stole (and then sold) the lute of an obnoxiously terrible bard named Renod Even-Toned. If persuaded or intimidated into admitting that he stole the lute, Crouches may cruelly suggest setting up Renod to likely get killed, by sending him to visit a bandit \"friend\" of his at Capstone Cave, who lives in a bandit hidecout cave north of the city.\r\nCrouches usually wears a hood. He is armed with two daggers on his belt.\r\nHere is an example of Crouches-In-Crevices' dialogue if approached at night:\r\n\"Listen. It's not going to do me any good to kill you. Drawing more attention to myself - not a good business plan. In my line of work, anyway. So, I'll let you live, under the... let's call it a good faith assumption, that you're not a paladin of righteousness or a complete idiot. And perhaps your knowledge of my trade can prove... useful to both of us. See, I'm a... merchant without excessive scruples, you might say. Someone who'll buy what you're selling no matter where it came from, understand? A fence. Just in case you hadn't cottoned on by now. So, you just, uhh, come around here whenever you have some stolen goods to hawk. I hang around here late at night, around ten, 'till about four.\"",
