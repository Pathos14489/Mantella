He also teaches Speech at Master level.\r\nAsking any Bard in Skyrim about where they learned their craft will result in their pointing the Dragonborn towards Solitude, where they can potentially become a member of the College. Viarmo is the man spoken to before gaining admittance, which leads the Dragonborn to locate the last remaining copy of King Olaf's Verse.\r\nAfter the Burning of King Olaf, Giraud sends the Dragonborn to locate Rjorn's Drum. After returning the Drum, he increases the skills Block, Archery, One-Handed, Two-Handed, Smithing and Heavy Armor each by one point.\r\nGiraud believes that King Olaf's Verse is in Dead Men's Respite, and speaks of this to the Dragonborn during the quest.\r\nI have Rjorn's Drum. \"At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years. The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.\"",
