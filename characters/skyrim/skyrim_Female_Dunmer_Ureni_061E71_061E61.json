    "bio": "Ureni is a Dark Elf mage who is acquainted with the residents of Sarethi Farm. Her story is designed to complement that of Avrusa and Aduri Sarethi. Like Aduri, Ureni\u2019s mother was a free spirit who left the farm to chase her artistic dreams. Ureni, on the other hand, has a more practical mind, and her similarities to Avrusa serves to deepen the divide between the Sarethi sisters. Ureni also travels with a wild dog, which is the source of much consternation for the Dunmer. It follows her to and from Riften, paying no heed to her constant barrage of insults. If the player meets the pair, she attempts to unload the dog onto them.",
