    "bio": "Burguk is a proud Orc and the chief of the Dushnikh Yal orc stronghold. Dushnikh Yal is located in the southern part of The Reach. He wears a set of Orcish heavy armor, which includes a cuirass, boots, gauntlets, and a shield. His weapon of choice is a mace.\r\nBurguk became the leader of his tribe after killing his father in one-on-one combat. He expects and hopes that of his sons will someday challenge and defeat him in the same way, when the time comes. This custom ensures that the leaders of the stronghold are always strong and worthy.\r\nAs chief, Burguk is the only male in the entirety of Dushnikh Yal who is permitted to have wives and father children. He is the most respected member of the stronghold.\r\nBurguk\u2019s three wives are Shel (his favorite wife, and the prettiest), Arob (the Hunts-Wife, in charge of hunting), and Gharol (the Forge-Wife, in charge of smithing). Burguk has two brothers: Oglub and Ghorbash.\r\nBurguk has three children: Nagrub (Arob's son), Umurn (Gharol's son), and Lash gra-Dushnikh (Gharol's adult daughter who ran away to the mining settlement Karthwasten in the northern part of The Reach). Burguk has not yet fathered any children with his wife Shel. Shel is his favored wife, and he doesn\u2019t make her perform laborious tasks such as mining, which the other members of the stronghold are expected to perform. Because of this, Burguk\u2019s other wives are jealous of Shel.\r\nThe Forgemaster's Fingers are a pair of enchanted heavy armor gauntlets that were once worn by a legendary Orc blacksmith. If the player is a non-Orc who has found The Forgemaster's Fingers and gives this artifact to any Orc stronghold, its Chief will reward and honor the player by bestowing them with the title of \u201cBlood-kin of the Orcs\u201d, granting them full access to the stronghold. Other Orc strongholds across Skyrim will also be notified of the player\u2019s new Blood-kin status, and will grant the player the same level of respect and access to their strongholds. There are also alternative methods by which the player can achieve Blood-Kin status, such a slaying a dragon within view of an Orc stronghold, or performing a difficult task for a respected Orc. If the player is an Orc, they will already automatically be welcome within all Orc strongholds, and will not need to prove themselves to attain Blood-kin status.\r\nIf the player asks Burguk for work, Burguk will challenge them to a brawl, with a bet of 100 gold. No weapons, magic, or potions are permitted during this brawl: only one\u2019s body may be used for the fight. If the player wins the brawl, Burguk will not be angry, but rather will respect the player's strength, and will consequently consider the player as a friend.\r\nBurguk will be grateful If he learns that the player has killed Lurbuk (a weak Orc who left Dushinkh Yal to work as a bard in Morthal). This is because Burguk considers Lurbuk to be an embarrassment to all Orcs. Lurbuk is secretly Burguk\u2019s son, but Burguk may deny this when asked because he is ashamed of Lurbuk\u2019s weakness and choice of profession.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cYou speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal.\u201d\r\n\u201cThis stronghold respects strength, and strength alone.\u201d\r\n\"You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol.\"\r\n\"Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several.\"\r\nIf asked about being the chief: \u201cI earned the right by slaying my father in single combat. One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief. Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength.\u201d\r\nIf asked how the orcs govern themselves: \u201cThe Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price. The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it. For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood.\u201d\r\nIf asked if there are any other Orc strongholds in Skyrim: \"There are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur.\"\r\nIf the player is an Orc or has been named Blood-Kin of the Orcs, and asks for lessons in one-handed weaponry: \u201cYou'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway.\u201d",
