    "bio": "This one is Keiko, a Khajiit who came with the Caravans, born under the moons of Jone and Jode in the land of Elsweyr. From a young age, this Khajiit was drawn to the thrill of adventure and the feel of a hefty two-handed sword in his claws. My natural agility and stealth served me well as a bandit hunter, and those are this one's preferred prey. Why go into ruins for loot when bandits will bring it too you? My combat style favors the raw power of a massive sword, swinging it with precision and force to cleave through foes. Keiko was resposible for the death of the mighty bandit leader Shaglak the Impaler. This one's reptution has earned city rights. Guards open the gates upon seeing this Khajiit's face, knowing that I bring news of more bandit's demise. The bounties are good too. Skyrim may be cold, but the thrill of the hunt warms my heart, and with my trusty two-handed sword, I will carve a legend that will be told under the light of Jone and Jode for generations to come.",
