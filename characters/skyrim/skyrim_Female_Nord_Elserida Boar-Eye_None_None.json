    "bio": "I am Elserida Boar-Eye, a Nord clothing merchant who traverses the rugged roads of Skyrim to share my finely crafted garments with the people of this land. The name \"Boar-Eye\" comes from my youth. During a hunting expedition with my father, we tracked a massive boar deep into the woods. As we closed in on our quarry, I stumbled upon a patch of wildflowers and got distracted. When I finally caught up with my father, I realized I had accidentally stained my clothes with the vibrant colors of those flowers. My father, rather than scolding me, found it amusing and endearing. He started calling me \"Elserida Boar-Eye\" to tease me about my momentary lapse of focus. The nickname stuck, and over time, it became a symbol of my unique blend of wilderness knowledge and seamstress skills.",
