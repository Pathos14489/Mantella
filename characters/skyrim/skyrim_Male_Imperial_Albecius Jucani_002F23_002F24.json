    "bio": "Albecius Jucani lives in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. He and his wife Ruccia have two children: older adolescent daughter Eddvia, and younger son Banus. They live in a large mansion in Bruma's upper-class western district. The family has recently been undergoing some turmoil. Eddvia is wayward and headstrong, and insists on continuing her romantic relationship with a local blacksmith named Hulgard, to whom she is apprencticed. Albecius and his wife are trying to arrange for Eddvia to marry Calius, a charming diplomat in the Imperial City. Also, the family dog Scruffy (of whom Banus is quite fond) has gone missing.\r\nAlbecius can often be found perusing the market stalls. After the afternoon and early evening, he and his wife can often be found sipping wine in the outside seating area of the Jerall View Inn. On Morndas, Middas and Fredas (Monday, Wednesday and Friday), he often indulges in the Jerall View Inn's basement bathhouse in the evening. On Sundas (Sunday) evening, he usually visits the Cathedral of Saint Martin.\r\nLike most people in Cyrodiil, Albecius and his family are ethnically Imperial. He is heavily balding and sports a thick gray-brown goatee. As befits his high status, Albecius wears expensive fine Colovian-style clothing, complete with jewelry.\r\nHere is an example of a verbal exchange Albecius might have with his wife and daughter:\r\nAlbecius: \"Enough of this, Eddvia. You're letting your bullheadedness get the better of you. If only you'd see him again-\"\r\nEddvia: \"See him again?! You have to be kidding me! I've seen him already! He's an arrogant, cocky bastard that I want nothing to do with! You understand?! Nothing! I'd rather kiss Hermaeus Mora than that scamp Calius! Then again, that's what he is, isn't he? A writhing mass of tentacles and slime!\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Such vitriol, Eddvia! To think, I raised you to be such a nice, sweet...\"\r\nRuccia: \"Eddvia, dear, please, understand. Your father has the right of it. I agree with him. Calius is perfect for you.\"\r\nEddvia: \"Perfect? And who are you to tell me that? Surely that's my decision?! It is for everyone else, but somehow not for me? Admit it. You just want me to marry him so you'll be able to share in his family's wealth and influence.\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Eddvia, I...\"\r\nEddvia: \"Go on. Say it.\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Enough of this. And enough causing a scene, too. We'll talk about it some more, later. And in private.\"\r\nHere is an example of a verbal exchange Albecius might have with someone in the marketplace:\r\nAlbecius: \"Well met, Rilja.\"\r\nRilja: \"Albecius? Well, this is a bit of a surprise... what brings you to my stall?\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Banus's birthday is coming up soon. My wife says he likes your little trinkets, so I was thinking of buying a couple for him.\"\r\nRilja: \"With all due respect, sir, these aren't just 'trinkets'. They're cultural artifacts, and-\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Rilja, please. Just sell me a knicknack that my boy would like. Understand?\"\r\nRilja: \"...I see. Well, here. I'm sure he'd love this old dagger. It's dull, so he won't hurt himself either.\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Great. I'll take it. Thank you for your service, Rilja.\"\r\nHere is an example of a verbal exchange Albecius might have with a beggar:\r\nSerulius: \"Please, sir. Take pity on an old veteran. Just this once...\"\r\nAlbecius: \"This again? Serulius, you and I both know you will just spend it on mead.\"\r\nSerulius: \"Not so! Me, I'm sober, I swear...\"\r\nAlbecius: \"No, you're not - I can smell it on your breath. Gods, you are wretched.\"\r\nSerulius: \"That so? Well, Albecius, one day our places will be reversed. We'll see just how pretentious you are then...\"\r\nAlbecius: \"Ah, but that day is not today, Serulius. And until that time, I think I'll be keeping my coin.\"\r\nHere are some examples of Albecius' dialogue if approached by the player:\r\n\"I am Albecius, of the Jucani family.\"\r\n\"I am privileged to enjoy quite a comfortable life, but I do try to give something back to the less-fortunate folk, when I can. The Great War took its toll on us. On all Cyrodiil. She may not look so different on the surface, but her spirit writhes in agony.\"\r\n\"The Jucani family is quite old, and quite influential. When we say things, people - important people - tend to listen. That's not to say that we're the Elder Council, but we don't tend to be ignored, either. That's not to say we don't pick up on new opportunities when we can, of course! Our family must always strive for bigger and better things. Not to sound like a priest of Saint Martin, heh.\"",
