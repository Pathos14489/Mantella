He believes his son, Jervar, is not smart enough to be a stable master like him. None of the horses in his possession are older than nine years and the youngest horse is six. The horse he is selling is seven years old.\r\nSkulvar may be a target for this Companions quest. The Dragonborn must locate him in a radiant location, and bring him back to Whiterun.\r\nSkulvar: \"You shoe that gelding, boy?\"Jervar: \"Yes, father.\"Skulvar: \"Groom her, too?\"Jervar: \"You know I did.\"Skulvar: \"You clean out that muck?\"Jervar: \"Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?\"Skulvar: \"Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.\"",
