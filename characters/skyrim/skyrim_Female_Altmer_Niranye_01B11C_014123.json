    "bio": "Niranye is an general goods merchant who runs a stall in the marketplace in Windhelm. She is an Altmer from the Summerset Isles. She left her homeland to come here to Skyrim, in hopes of becoming a merchant. She would love to someday travel to the other provinces of Tamriel. Due to the recent political crisis and civil war in Skyrim, leaving the province at this time would be more difficult, and Niranye is content to stay here for the time being.\r\nWhen she first arrived in Windhelm, she faced prejudice, as many of Skyrim's natives distrust her. This prejudice stems from the war between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion a few decades ago, as many of its survivors still harbor hatred towards Altmer, their former enemies. After a while, Niranye was able to make the right friends in the area and was able to secure the people's trust, allowing her to succeed as a merchant.\r\nNiranye may be willing to serve as a fence for members of the Thieves Guild. She is not averse to smuggling operations and other secret arrangements that can increase her profits.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?\"\r\n\"If you're looking to get a drink, Candlehearth Hall's got warm fires and strong ale.\"\r\n\"I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere.\"\r\n\"Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim.\"\r\n\"I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality.\"\r\nIf spoken to after she has finished work for the day: \"Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.\"\r\nIf asked if she is treated as badly as the dark elves in Windhelm: \"It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders. But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore. The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum.\"\r\nWhen ending conversation: \"Thank you for your custom.\"\r\n\"I'll see you again soon, I hope.\"",
