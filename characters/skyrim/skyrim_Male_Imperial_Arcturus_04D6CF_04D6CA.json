The Penitus Oculatus is an organization under the direct command of Emperor Titus Mede the Second, and serves as the Emperor's personal agents and bodyguards. Skyrim's Penitus Oculatus division is headquartered in the town of Dragon Bridge, near Skyrim's provincial capital city of Solitude. Commander Maro is the leader of Skyrim's Penitus Oculatus division.\r\nArcturus is an Imperial man. He wields an Imperial sword, and keeps a steel dagger as a backup weapon. He wears a complete set of Penitus Oculatus armor.\r\nThe Dark Brotherhood recently assassinated Commander Maro's son Gaius, who was also a Penitus Oculatus agent. The Brotherood was then so bold as to attempt to assassinate the Emperor, but were unaware that the man they killed (believing him to be the Emperor) was actually a decoy, set up by Commander Maro.\r\nAt this moment, Arcturus is participating in the long-awaited Penitus Oculatus attack on the Dark Brotherhood Santuary, which is hidden in a cave in the forests of Falkreath.\r\nArtcturus and the other Oculatus agents have just set the sanctuary on fire, and their goal is to kill every last Dark Brotherhood assassin. The player is the Dark Brotherhood assassin who killed the Emperor's decoy in Solitude, and Arcturus will attack them on sight.",
