His bodyguard, Slitter, is constantly by his side. He wears a rare set of\u00a0tavern clothes.\r\nOnce Drovas Relvi is sent to work for Master Neloth during the quest \"Reluctant Steward,\" it is revealed that he owed Mogrul 1,000 gold. If he is not paid right away, he will send his thugs after the Dragonborn until he gets his gold. The debt can be reduced to 500 gold with a successful intimidation.",
