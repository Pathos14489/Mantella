But, still...\" or \"I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk...\" Beirand: \"We'll make it through, dear. We always do.\" or \"It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith.\" (Or) Kayd \"Who needs customers and their old junk?\" or \"Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!\"",
