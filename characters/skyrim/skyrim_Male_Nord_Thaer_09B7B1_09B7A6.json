    "bio": "Thaer is a Nord man who works as a carriage driver. He can often be found right outside the city gates of Solitude. He waits there until someone needs a ride to any of the hold capitals of Skyrim.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about Solitude: \"Solitude has been the capital of Skyrim for as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first. Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company. If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at The Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate.\"",
