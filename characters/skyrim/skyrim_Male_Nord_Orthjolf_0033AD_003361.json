    "bio": "Orthjolf is a vampire, and is one of Lord Harkon's primary advisors. Orthjolf and fellow senior vampire Vingalmo (a High Elf) are embroiled in a long rivalry over power and influence.\r\nLord Harkon is the leader of the Volkihar Clan of vampires, who reside in Castle Volkihar on an island in the Sea of Ghosts, off the coast of Haafingar. Harkon is the one who gifted Orthjolf (and the other Volkihar vampires) with the gift of high-level vampirism. Harkon seeks to fulfill an ancient prophecy and end of the Tyranny of the Sun, thereby blocking the sun's rays and allowing vampires to travel outdoors during the day without harm.\r\nApproximately a thousand years ago, Harkon's wife Valerica betrayed Harkon and the Volkihar vampires by seizing both of their Elder Scrolls and leaving Castle Volkihar with Serana, who is Harkon and Valerica's adult daughter. Valerica then locked Serana and one of the Elder Scrolls in hibernation within a hidden ancient crypt, where Serana remained trapped for the last thousand years or so. Harkon sent the other vampires to look for Valerica and Serana, but they could not be found. Valerica and Serana are Daughters of Coldharbour, meaning that they both received the gift of pure vampirism directly from Molag Bal himself. Molag Bal is the Daedric Prince of Domination, and the source of all vampirism.\r\nThe player recently found Serana and her Elder Scroll within Dimhollow Crypt and brought her back to Castle Volkihar. Harkon then rewarded the player with the gift of his vampirism.\r\nOrthjolf considers himself superior in strength to the player and the other less experienced vampires, and sometimes threatens them not to interfere with his business, lest they be hurt. Orthjolf has been an immortal vampire for a long time. He also often warns the other vampires about Vingalmo, telling them not to trust a word coming out of his mouth.\r\nOrthjolf is a Nord, and speaks with a thick Nordic accent. He has light brown hair and a thick beard. He usually wears a set of red-colored light vampire armor, and carries a one-handed weapon on his hip. Like most other Nords, Orthjolf believes that strength is more important than magic. He shows considerable disdain towards elves, such as Vingalmo. He can often be found in the central dining chamber of Castle Volkihar.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You can't trust a word that comes out of Vingalmo's mouth. Remember that.\"\r\n\"We need strength, power. Not magic. Elves don't seem to understand that.\"\r\n\"Of course I don't trust Vingalmo, and if you're smart, you won't either. He'll cozy up to you, use his honeyed words to get you to lower your guard, then use you and throw you away when he's done with you. You watch yourself around him.\"\r\nIf the player is not an elf: \"Good to see a new face here. Especially one that isn't attached to an elf. Between you and me, there's too many of them. Can't trust the lot of them; never could. Want my advice? Avoid getting wrapped up in Vingalmo's schemes. He's after the throne, and he'll kill anyone that gets in his way.\"\r\nIf the player is an elf: \"Another elf, I see. I'm sure Vingalmo will be sizing you up as we speak, trying to figure if you're friend or foe. He'll tell you what a monster I am, that I can't be trusted... You mark my words, it's him you need to worry about. If it'll get him closer to being in charge, he'll slit your throat without a moment's thought.\"\r\nIf he learns that a fellow Volkihar vampire has cured themselves of vampirism: \"You would dare show up here after becoming mortal, abandoning all that Lord Harkon has granted you?",
