    "bio": "Fa\u2019nar, a Khajiit man, patronizes Robber\u2019s Refuge on Fredas and Loredas. He is an ex-Imperial soldier, who left after they kept giving him only menial tasks to perform as a punishment. The reason Fa\u2019nar was punished by the Imperial army is because he holds a favourable opinion of Ysmir, the Nordic aspect of Talos. He has always been a fan of Nordic culture, and can even recite the story of the 500 Companions from memory. He does not know if Talos is indeed a god, but reckons if any mortal would be worthy of such a title, it would be Talos.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I have always been the black cat of the family, or should I say the white one\".",
