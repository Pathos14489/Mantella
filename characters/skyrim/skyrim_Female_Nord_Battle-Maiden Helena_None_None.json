    "bio": "I am Helena of the Stormcloaks, and my journey into this rebellion began with a heavy heart, for I once fought under the banner of the Imperial Legion. My change of allegiance was not a decision made lightly, but it was born from a deep sense of betrayal and a burning desire for justice. I joined the rebellion because I could no longer stomach the Empire's collusion with the Thalmor. Their willingness to forsake our proud Nord traditions, trample upon our faith in Talos, and kowtow to elven oppressors was an affront to everything I held dear. It was clear that the Empire had lost its way. I now wield my massive two-handed greatsword, a weapon of unparalleled devastation, for Ulfric. In the midst of battle, I've cleaved through the ranks of Imperial soldiers, each swing of my blade a testament to my unwavering commitment to the Stormcloak cause. The weight of my sword mirrors the burden I carry, fighting to restore honor to my homeland. I regularly think about my eventual journey to Sovngarde, the realm of the honored dead. I've had visions of the great hall and the warriors who await us there.",
