    "bio": "Rundi is a deceased apprentice mage with the College of Winterhold.\r\nRundi's frozen corpse can be found at the unmarked location Rundi's Altar northwest of Journeyman's Nook and southeast of Winterhold. His dagger can be found there, as well as a Staff of Ice Spikes and an Alchemy skill book. Inside are several frost rune traps.\r\nAlthough able to be found at any point, Phinis Gestor will mention Rundi and his brother amongst four students who went missing from College of Winterhold, recalling they were working on a way to magically chill mead. Due to the unfinished nature of the quest, there is no further mentioning of him, quest stages, or objectives that point to his location. The scene where he can be found suggests he was still investigating Frost magic upon death.",
