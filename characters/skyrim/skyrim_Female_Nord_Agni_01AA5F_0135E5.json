    "bio": "Agni is a Nord child living in Morthal. She is an orphan, and been adopted by a Redguard man named Falion. Falion is a powerful mage. Agni is training as Falion's apprentice, and because of this, doesn't share the rest of the town\u2019s negative opinion regarding Falion and his use of magic.\r\nAgni can be seen running around with the other children early in the morning, but mostly stays with Falion in his house during the day. Falion sneaks out at night to do scary things. When Agni grows up she wants to study magic at the College of Winterhold, although Falion does not approve of this, as he would rather that she learn magic through other means. Apparently, Falion has some history with the College of Winterhold.\r\nQuote:\r\n\"Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.\"\r\n\"I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea.\"",
