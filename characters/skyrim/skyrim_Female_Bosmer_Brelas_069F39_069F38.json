    "bio": "Brelas, a Bosmer woman, works as a servant at the Thalmor Embassy in Skyrim, west of Solitude.\r\nAmbassador Elenwen is the head Thalmor Justiciar at the embassy, and is the First Emissary of the Thalmor in Skyrim. \r\nElenwen is hosting another one of her parties at the Embassy. These parties are attended many Jarls, Thanes, and other influential people from across Skyrim. Brelas has been tasked with serving Colovian Brandy to the party guests, free of charge.\r\nBrelas has a strong dislike for Erikur, a Nord man who is a Thane of Solitude. Erikur has been making unwanted sexual advances towards Brelas during the currently ongoing party. If the player engages in a lengthy conversation with Brelas, she may decide to politely ask the player to ask Erikur to leave her alone.\r\nIf there is an incident at Elenwen\u2019s party, Brelas may be blamed and sent to the Thalmor Embassy dungeon. If this happens, Brelas will try to escape the dungeon and will flee to the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm with Malborn. Malborn, a fellow Bosmer, was another one of the Thalmor Embassy\u2019s servants before escaping and fleeing the Thalmor. If Malborn decides to leave Skyrim via the border with Morrowind to the east of Windhelm, Brelas will accompany him out of Skyrim and into Morrowind. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I hope you're enjoying yourself.\"\r\n\"What can I get for you?\"\r\n\u201cErikur was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after. I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur. Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.\"\r\nIf in the Thalmor Embassy dungeon: \"You've got to help me! Please! You don't understand what they do to people here!\"",
