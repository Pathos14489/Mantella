    "bio": "Gorm is a Nord in Skyrim who is the bodyguard of Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone of Morthal.\r\nIf Gorm is spoken to at the Moorside Inn, without the Jarl nearby, he will ask for assistance in his plan to overthrow Idgrod. He will then give the Dragonborn Gorm's Letter to deliver to Captain Aldis in Solitude.\r\nDoing this does not provide a quest entry in the journal, and delivering the letter does not result in any reward higher than 20 gold. It does, however, count toward helping the citizens of Morthal, satisfying one of Jarl Idgrod's requirements for becoming a Thane.\r\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War or trades Hjaalmarch during \"Season Unending,\" Gorm will relocate to the Blue Palace in Solitude alongside Idgrod and the other Imperial supporters.",
