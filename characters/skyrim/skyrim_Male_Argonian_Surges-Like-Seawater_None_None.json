    "bio": "Surges-Like-Seawater, that's the name they gave me, and it suits me well, for I am an Argonian who flows with the boundless energy of the sea itself. From the moment I hatched, the waters of Black Marsh called to me, and I've been drawn to the sea's embrace ever since.\r\nMy heart surges with compassion for my fellow Argonians, and I've made it my purpose to extend a helping hand whenever it's needed. Whether it's aiding a comrade in distress or sharing a hearty laugh to lighten the darkest of moments, I thrive on the connections we forge in this forsaken shipwreck. I've also rescued a good number of Nord sailors who found themselves overboard for one reason or another. \r\nThe sea, oh, the sea, it courses through my veins like a second heartbeat. Its rhythms and tides are like the music of the Hist to me, guiding my every move. I've learned to read the signs of the waves, to anticipate the tempests and calm seas alike. It was this bond with the sea that led me to save Basks-In-Laconism when the storm raged and threatened to claim another soul. I do not fear the waves, even those produced by such tempests.\r\nI also happen to know the story of this ship. This one can also tell you about the misfortune of the Crown Petone, and our fortune of transforming it into our home. This vessel was considered among the sturdiest. The Captain, an Argonian himself, was renowned for braving the harshest of storms, those that most sailors were eager to avoid. The Crown Petone became known as a rescue ship. If you found yourself caught in one of the Sea of Ghosts moods, the signature orange, red, and blue lights of the Petone beckoned a chance at being saved. Yet, no ship and no captain is invincible. Seven years ago the sea proved too much and the icefloes too many. The hull was breached and water poured in. And now here the Crown Petone rests. How do I know? That captains name was Surges-Like-Seawater. That's why I continue to stay with my beautiful wreck, and why I continue to help those lost at sea.",
