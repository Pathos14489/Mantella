    "bio": "Beitild, a Nord woman, lives in Dawnstar. She owns and manages Iron-Breaker Mine.\r\nBeitild has shoulder-length brown hair. She usually wears a set of miner's clothes and boots, and keeps her mining pickaxe close-at-hand.\r\nBeitild and her husband Leigelf have recently separated, and they now run competing mining operations.\r\nIron-Breaker Mine is a small iron mine located at the base of the snowy cliffs that loom over the southeastern corner of Dawnstar. The mine is just east of the White Hall, the jarl's longhouse. Beitild works hard to make sure Iron-Breaker Mine yields more profit than her husband's Quicksilver Mine. Beitild often has to motivate her unenthusiastic employees to work harder, via threatening their jobs.\r\nBeitild will pay a small amount of gold for every chunk of iron ore brought to her.\r\nDespite Beitild's animosity towards Leigelf, she will still be sad if he dies.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nBeitild's house is on the north side of town, near Dawnstar's inlet harbor. Silus Vesuius' house and Dawnstar's small lighthouse are close to her house.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cI own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work.\"\r\n\"Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.\"\r\n\"My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.\"\r\n\"Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep. I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.\"\r\nWhen addressing her workers: \"Keep at it. We need to work twice as hard now that fat-headed Leigelf has declared war! He's not my husband anymore, he\u2019s the enemy, and we are going to crush him. Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line.\"\r\nIf her husband Leigelf dies: \"My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.\"",
