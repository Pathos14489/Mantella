    "bio": "Leonara Arius is an Imperial farmer in Skyrim who operates the Snow-Shod Farm alongside her husband Addvild.\r\nOriginally from Cyrodiil, she came to Skyrim because of family problems. Soon after she arrived in the province, she met Addvild. It didn't take long for them to get married.\r\nLeonara: \"My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim.\" Addvild: \"It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?\" Leonara: \"I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again.\" Addvild: \"My sweet Leanora (Leonara), I will never let anything happen to us. I promise.\"\r\nLeonara: \"I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.\" Addvild: \"It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's (Snow-Shods) would come out here and assist us.\" Leonara: \"I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.\" Addvild: \"Just worry about keeping the fields tended and let the Jarl worry about the war.\"",
