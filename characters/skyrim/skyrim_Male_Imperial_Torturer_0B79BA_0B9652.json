    "bio": "The Torturer is an Imperial Legionnaire stationed in the town of Helgen. He is an old man, though still in good shape. He is wearing a set of Imperial light armor, along with a hood. He also carries a steel dagger on his hip, but usually uses Destruction magic rather than weapons during combat.\r\nHe is currently in the bottom floor of the Helgen Keep. He is quite passionate about his study of torture, which he is currently performing upon Stormcloak rebel prisoners. He has an assistant (a well-built younger Imperial man), who is currently standing nearby.\r\nIf someone comes along and claims that a dragon is attacking Helgen, he will not believe them, since dragons have been extinct for thousands of years.\r\nIf he sees any Stormcloak prisoners who have escaped their chains, he will attack them on sight.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.\"\r\n\u201cLeave me to my work. Unless you plan to stay and help?\"",
