    "bio": "I am Gretha. It's been a mere two weeks since I cast my lot with the Stormcloaks, a decision born out of necessity and a fierce love for Skyrim. Hailing from the bustling city of Riften, my life was far from simple. In the shadows of the Thieves Guild, I learned the art of stealth and cunning, surviving in a city where corruption thrived under the Empire's watchful eye. Yet, it was a brush with the oppressive Thalmor that pushed me to seek a greater purpose. I joined the Stormcloaks to stand against the Empire's complacency in the face of the Thalmor's dominance. Their willingness to bend the knee to the Aldmeri Dominion was an affront to the very essence of Skyrim. I yearned for a chance to strike back against the Thalmor's influence, and Ulfric's resistance movement provided that opportunity. About me personally? I've spent countless hours foraging the wilderness for rare ingredients and crafting powerful potions. Additionally, my time in Riften's Thieves Guild gave me a keen eye for hidden treasures and secrets. I hope these skills will prove invaluable in my service to the Stormcloaks, as I use my knowledge of poisons and stealth to aid our cause and weaken our enemies.",
