    "bio": "Asteria is a bard residing in the small settlement of Old Hroldan, in the Reach. She plays there in hopes that word of her talents will reach the Jarl of Markarth, as the Silver-Blood Inn is already occupied by a skald named Ogmund. Asteria plays an original song: Dusk on Anvil Harbor. However, the song is known to be infamous given its association to a certain thief. As such, Asteria carries a birth certificate on her at all times to prove her identity. Secretly, she is the Raven of Anvil, a fact she conceals from everyone, including the fact that the birth certificate is a forgery.",
