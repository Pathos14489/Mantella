    "bio": "Froa is a former Stormcloak soldier who served under Haakon Iron-Fist in Karthwasten. After she left the army, Froa met a High Elf woman named Arilwaen who secretly leads a group of Talos worshippers and works clandestinely against the Thalmor. Froa then agreed to aid Arilwaen in her quest, and they have been working together ever since.\r\nFroa has sometimes been called \u201cBear-Foot Froa\u201d, which is a pun regarding her bear-like tenacity and bare feet. Froa always goes barefoot.",
