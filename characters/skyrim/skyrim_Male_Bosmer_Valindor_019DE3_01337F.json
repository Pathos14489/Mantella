    "bio": "Valindor, a Bosmer, lives in Riften and works at the Riften Fishery.\r\nHe describes how he remembers Valenwood looking, because the Riften trees remind him of autumn in Valenwood. Valindor, like most people of Riften, is tired of Riften's corruption by Maven Black-Briar, and wants to leave.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.\"\r\n\"The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.\"\r\n\"Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.\"\r\n\"I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.\"\r\n\"On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead.\"\r\n\"Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on.\"\r\nIf asked how he works at both the Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted: \"Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing.\"",
