    "bio": "Larina is an Imperial, who dies in Hob's Fall Cave. Larina stole Pantea Ateia's Flute, leading to her being sacrificed by the necromancers she tried to sell it to. The necromancers claimed to be reviving the Order of the Black Worm.\r\nPantea Ateia tells the Dragonborn about a foolish student named Larina who stole Pantea's flute, and sold it to a coven of necromancers. Since the flute was passed down through seventeen generations, Pantea asks the Dragonborn to find it and bring it back to her.\r\nWhen the cave is entered, Larina will shout, \"You have to help me, they're going to kill me!\" However, her death is scripted and she will always be dead by the time the Dragonborn reaches her, and possibly reanimated by the necromancers when they turn hostile.",
