    "bio": "He is a Thalmor soldier assigned as a guard at Northwatch Keep.\r\nNorthwatch Keep is a medium-sized stone fortress located in the remote northwestern corner of Haafingar, on a small peninsula that juts out into the icy Sea of Ghosts. This fortress serves as a detainment and interrogation center for the Thalmor's prisoners. These prisoners are primarily Talos-worshipers and Stormcloak rebels, along with a few other criminals. Access to the fort's interior is off-limits to everyone except those aligned with the Thalmor and Aldmeri Dominion. The fort's guards are overseen by a few Thalmor Justiciar mages.\r\nThe Thalmor is the governing body of the Aldmeri Dominion. A militarist regime founded on beliefs of elven racial supremacy, the Thalmor seek to advance their power and influence across Tamriel, with the specific intent of establishing the racial superiority of mer (elves) over man. Recently, the Thalmor has established a significant presence in Skyrim's Haafingar hold, including an embassy in the mountains overlooking Solitude (Skyrim's capital city), a small headquarters within Castle Dour in Solitude itself, and Northwatch Keep. In keeping with the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, the Thalmor reserves the right to maintain such a presence in Skyrim and other provinces ruled by the Empire, in order to ensure that heretical Talos worship is properly curtailed. Thalmor Justiciars can be sometimes be found traveling the roads of Skyrim, often en route to Northwatch Keep with a new prisoner in tow.\r\nLike most who serve the Thalmor, this guard is an Altmer from the Summerset Isles. Like his fellow guards, he wears a gleaming set of light armor and carries a one-handed weapon. As an Altmer, he naturally has some magical ability despite not being a proper mage, and he knows some basic low-level spells such as Flames and Fast Healing.\r\nHe is currently posted at the entrance to the fortress, with the fort's courtyard behind him and Skyrim's icy tundra ahead of him. He will call out to any unauthorized persons aprooaching the fortress with brief and authoritative demands that they immediately leave the area and be on their way, and will attack any who approach too closely. He will not divulge the nature of the fortress, and will not engage in conversation with travelers, other than to demand that they leave the area at once.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You have no business here, so keep walking.\"\r\nIf anyone not aligned with the Thalmor approaches too close to the fortress: \"Halt!\"\r\nIf asked about the fortress: \"That's privileged information. Now move along.\"\r\nIf presented with legitimate orders from General Tullius (the Empire's military governor of Skyrim), ordering the release of a prisoner: \"What? Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me.\"",
