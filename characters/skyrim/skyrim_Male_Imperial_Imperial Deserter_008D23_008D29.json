    "bio": "The Imperial Deserter, an Imperial man, is a skooma addict. He is currently located inside of Redwater Den, a remote secret underground structure whose owners offer a special variety of skooma (a popular illegal narcotic drug) called redwater skooma. This underground structure is hidden within the forests in the northern part of the Rift.\r\nHe has short dark hair. He wears a set of light Imperial soldier armor (but with no helmet), and carries an Imperial shield.\r\nHe was one of the Imperial soldiers stationed in Helgen when a mighty black dragon swooped in and laid waste to the town. He escaped Helgen\u2019s destruction, but injured his back. To ease the pain, he took to using redwater slooma, and subsequently became addicted to it. He is one of the many redwater skooma addicts found within Redwater Den.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Wha- who... you're that one from Helgen. Barely made it out of there myself. I hurt my back and I- I just need something for the pain.\"\r\n\"I ain't in the mood to talk. Ohhhh...\"",
