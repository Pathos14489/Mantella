    "bio": "Bersi Honey-Hand, a Nord man, is the proprietor of The Pawned Prawn, a general goods store in Riften. He is known for being charitable, and his wife Drifa often mentions that she wishes he would be more concerned with his own needs than the needs of others. Bersi and his wife live in the back of the store building. Bersi wears a set of merchant clothes along with a pair of boots. He is bald, but his beard is a reddish color.\r\nA former sailor, Bersi used to own a fishing boat, which he named the Brawny Prawn. After selling his boat, he named his shop to commemorate his former life. \r\nLike many other citizens of Riften, Bersi is concerned about the rampant corruption within the city. Unlike most, he believes in improving the morality of the citizens through worship at the Temple of Mara. This has earned him the ridicule of many other citizens, who are convinced that the corruption runs too deep to be removed with prayers.\r\nBersi currently owes a 100 gold debt to Brynjolf and the Thieves Guild. Bersi is fond of a valuable Dwemer urn that he keeps in his shop.\r\nQuotes: \r\nIf in the Pawned Prawn: \"Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. Come on in, take a look around. What can I do for you?\"\r\nIf in the Pawned Prawn: \"Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal.\"\r\nIf not in the Pawned Prawn: \"If you're looking for anything to sell for a fair price, I run the Pawned Prawn over by the market.\"\r\nAfter asked about the name of his shop: \u201cCatchy, isn\u2019t it? In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named \u2018The Brawny Prawn\u2019. But the years have a way of creeping up on you. I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose. If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake.\"\r\n\u201cThis city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.\"\r\n\u201cThe authorities are all dirty. Every one of them. The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.\"\r\nIf asked about the Thieves Guild: \u201cThey used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine. Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people. All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.\"\r\nIf asked about the Ratway: \u201cThe Ratway is the name for the old sewers that run under the city. It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay, just like the rest of Riften. The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there.\"\r\nIf asked about the Jarl of Riften: \"Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves.\"\r\nIf the player threatens to destroy his Dwemer urn: \"Please, I don't have anything to pay you with! Don't destroy my urn!\"\r\n",
