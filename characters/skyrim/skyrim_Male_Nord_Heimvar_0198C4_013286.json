    "bio": "Heimvar is a Nord\u00a0blacksmith. He lives and works in the Solitude Blacksmith building as the apprentice of Beirand.\r\nHe says that no man is a match for a dragon, but that at least buying one of their blades wouldn't hurt. He also tells the Dragonborn\u00a0that he thinks Jaree-Ra is a plague on the city, much like a few other citizens around Solitude.\r\nBeirand: \"Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do!\" or \"You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!\" Heimvar: \"Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for eight hours straight?\" or \"Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!\" Beirand: \"Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!\" or \"Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now.\"",
