    "bio": "J'darr is a Khajiit in the Alftand glacial ruins. He has long since been driven mad by Skooma withdrawals, and is standing next to the body of his brother, J'zhar.\r\nHowever, in spite of his Skooma withdrawal, the 'hallucinations' are implied to (in part) be the Falmer who inhabit the ruins, and it is in fact the Falmer who took Valie. J'darr and his brother are apparently the only two of the group to avoid the Falmer's grasp, but it is unclear whether J'darr killed J'zhar or if the latter died from unrecorded wounds.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
