    "bio": "Jonna is a Redguard innkeeper in Skyrim who resides in Morthal.\r\nShe is the sister of Falion and the owner of the Moorside Inn. When the Dragonborn talks to her, she will say that business is slow in Morthal.\r\nShe sells various food and drinks, and a room can be rented for 10 , as with all innkeepers.\r\nWhen asked about the burnt-down house right next to the inn, she will tell the Dragonborn about Hroggar and his family who recently passed away in the fire. This will start the quest.\r\nIs business in Morthal slow? \"Slow? No. It just ain't there at all. Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started. Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use.\" What's with the Orc? \"Lurbuk? Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay. If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around.\" Where can I learn more about magic? \"You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?\"\r\nIs there a story behind that burned down house? \"Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago. It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town. Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.\"\r\nI saw Helgi's ghost. \"The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father. Best tell the Jarl.\"\r\nWhat can you tell me about Laelette? \"Now there's a mystery. She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'. I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.\"",
