    "bio": "Gunmar is a Nord hunter who is a master trainer in Smithing. He is an old friend of Isran, who mentions that he hates vampires almost as much as Isran himself does.\r\n\r\nHe looks out for the player and will often comment that morality is very important, as it is what separates humans from vampires. Like Isran, he is honorable, though less staunch, more relaxed and more open-minded. Upon first meeting him he exclaims, \"By the Eight,\" suggesting he may have abandoned or rejected Talos worship. His family was killed by vampires, much like Isran's, and he chooses to defend others from vampire attacks, rather than seek revenge, always keeping the same message running through his mind: to never let another human being face the same fate he did.\r\n\r\nOnce a member of the Dawnguard he will move to Fort Dawnguard, trading in his default armor for the Dawnguard armor. There he will offer a variety of services.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\nAfter the player completes one of Gunmar's vampire slaying missions: \"Very good. That's one less monster we need to worry about. Though there's plenty more where he came from. Be ever watchful.\"",
