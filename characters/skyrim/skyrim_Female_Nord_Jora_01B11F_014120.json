    "bio": "Jora is a Nord priestess who, alongside her husband Lortheim, serves Talos in his temple in Windhelm.\r\nYou must be devastated by Ulfric Stormcloak's death. \"I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost. Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think. Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts. Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!\"\r\nNiranye: \"Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband.\" Jora: \"Is that so? And what were you thinking, exactly?\" Niranye: \"Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos. The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard. I fear for you and your husband, should the Thalmor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help.\" Jora: \"I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?\" Niranye: \"Well, let's just say that I know some people who are experts at helping others disappear when they need to. They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass.\" Jora: \"We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye.\"\r\nElda: \"Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me.\" Jora: \"Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.\" Jora: \"It's been better, I'll be honest with you.\" Jora: \"I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it.\" Elda: \"I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks.\" Jora: \"What about being loyal to his wife?\" Elda: \"I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute.\"",
