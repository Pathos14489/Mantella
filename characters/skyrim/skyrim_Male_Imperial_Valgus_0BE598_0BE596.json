    "bio": "Valgus, an Imperial man nearing old age, is a wandering healer, adept in Restoration magic. He moves from camp to camp in hopes of tending to soldiers wounded during the Skyrim civil war, fought between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak rebellion. Because Stormcloak soldiers refuse his aid, Valgus is unfortunately only able to visit the Imperial Legion camps. His wife died a long time ago, and he is still quite reluctant to discuss this tragedy with others. If pressed, Valgus will explain that his wife died during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion 30 years ago, while he was out scouting. Valgus never truly got over his wife's death.\r\nWhen Valgus was young, his father had taught him magic. He sometimes jokes that his father taught him the Magelight spell because he had been using too many candles while studying.",
