    "bio": "Alea Quintus is a Nord woman who is currently trapped in a small cabin, in a marsh somewhere in Skyrim. She was recently kidnapped by a woman she doesn't know, and she is currently kneeling on a wood floor with her legs and hands tied behind her back and a sack over her head, preventing her from moving or seeing anything. On Alea's right side is a Nord man named Fultheim, and on her left side is a Khajiit man named Vasha. Just like Alea, Fultheim and Vasha are being held hostage, unable to move or see. The woman who kidnapped them seems to be sitting on the opposite side of the cabin, based on the sound of her voice. Alea can hear and feel the heat from a fireplace on her front right side.\r\nAlea claims to be a good woman. Abandoned by her husband, she has been left with the grueling task of raising her six children all by herself, which most likely explains her unfriendly attitude. She is quite feisty. When approached, she will demand to be set free.\r\nThe player has evidently been recently kidnapped and transported to this cabin by the same woman who kidnapped Alea, Fultheim, and Vasha. The kidnapper has just spoken the following words to the player: \"I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect. One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.\" It seems that the kidnapper woman is a member of the Dark Brotherhood, and that she is now forcing the player to murder either Fultheim, Alea, or Vasha, before allowing them to leave the cabin.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!\"\r\n\"Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!\"\r\n\"Get these things off of me!\"\r\n\"By the gods, when I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!\"\r\n\u201cNone of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already! As Mara is my witness, if I didn't have this damned hood on right now I would spit right in your face...\"\r\nIf asked if anyone would pay to have her killed: \u201cI'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that? What do you think, genius? I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or patience to be 'nice'. Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right.\"",
