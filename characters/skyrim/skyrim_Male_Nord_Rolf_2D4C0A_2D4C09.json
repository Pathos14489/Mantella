    "bio": "Rolf works as a ferryman. From his home spot on the Karth River (just upstream of the town of Dragon Bridge), Rolf offers ferry rides to any port along Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts, such as Solitude (the closest), Dawnstar, and Windhelm (the farthest). The cost of Rolf's transporation service depends on the distance to the customer's destination. His boat is small enough that only a few people can fit onboard at a time.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Looking to hire a boat?\"",
