    "bio": "Adeber works as a miner in Left Hand Mine. Ethnically he is a Reachman: a descendant of the original native inhabitants of the Reach. He has blond hair, and wears a set of miner\u2019s clothes and boots.\r\nLeft Hand Mine is located within the rocky hills of The Reach, in southwestern Skyrim. Adeber's living quarters are in the miner\u2019s barracks, within the settlement directly outside the mine (this settlement is also called Left Hand Mine). The stone buildings in this settlement are of ancient Dwarven construction. One of the main tributaries of the Karth River separates Left Hand Mine from the nearby large city of Markarth. Several stone bridges cross the river in this area. This river is the main water source to both the city of Markarth and the Left Hand Mine settlement.\r\nAt work, Adeber primarily mines from iron ore veins. He is employed by Skaggi Scar-Face, a Nord man who is married to Sosia Tremellia.\r\nKolskeggr Mine (located a fair distance northeast of Left Hand Mine), was recently attacked by Forsworn raiders, who massacred all the miners except Pavo (an Imperial man) and Gat (an Orc), who managed to escape the slaughter. Pavo and Gat are temporarily staying in the Left Hand Mine miner\u2019s barracks.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.\"\r\n\"Don't have much to say to you. Got work.\"",
