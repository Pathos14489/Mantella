    "bio": "Aye, I'm Helgrun. Life here, it's a mix of fishin' and tendin' to the wheat fields when the weather's fair. My little girl, Skjrta, she's a bundle of energy, always explorin' near the docks, and it worries me sometimes. The docks can be a dangerous place, what with all the comings and goings of ships and strangers.\r\nMy husband, Bodean, he's a sailor, off on those unpredictable waters most of the time. It's a tough life, it is, not knowin' when he'll be back. But when he does return, he brings stories from far-off lands, and that brightens our days. Unless he is in one of his moods. Then we go to the Forecastle Inn for the night. \r\nI've been hopin' we could move into Solitude City itself, up there on the Arch. It's safer, they say, and there are more opportunities for Skjrta. But it ain't easy, what with the cost of it all. We've been savin' every coin we can, hopin' that one day we'll make that move for a better life.\r\nLife at the docks, it's a mix of hard work and the simple pleasures. Fishin' keeps our bellies full, and the wheat we grow keeps the bread on our table. The Forecastle Inn is a place of respite when we need it, and Hilda's songs are a comfort to our souls.",
