    "bio": "Bal-Ran is an expert marksman who hunts and fishes for the village of Little Vivec. This village is located on a few small islands and their connecting wooden platforms, in the middle of Lake Ilinalta in Skyrim. Despite Skyrim's overall cold climate and harsh landscapes, Lake Ilinalta and the surrounding lush forests of Falkreath Hold enjoy a relatively temperate climate. Little Vivec's watery surroundings and inter-connectedness via bridges makes the village thematically somewhat resemble the city of Vivec in Morrowind (before the city was destroyed by the Baar Dau meteor). Little Vivec can be accessed either by boat, or via a narrow wooden bridge connecting the village to the southern shore of the lake. The eccentric Belvadyr Rathvasi, who lives with his wife Velyna, is the leader of the village. Like the vast majority of village's residents, Bal-Ran is a Dunmer - specifically, a Dunmer refugee from Morrowind. He lives alone in a small shack at the edge of the village. He is a particularly devout follower of Azura. If a visiting adventurer asks Bal-Ran if he could use any help, Bal-Ran may mention a group of bandits who have been harassing the village somewhat recently. These bandits have a camp near Moss Creek to the southwest of Lake Ilinalta. If assisted with this problem, Bal-Ran may become willing to divulge the location of a certain... person of interest, who recently stopped by Little Vivec. This person confided to Bal-Ran that he was heading to the Dwemer Ruins of Kagrenar, in the Velothi Mountains far to the east (near Skyrim's border with Morrowind). Bal-Ran knows that this person of interest is secretly the Nerevarine of legend, but he will not voluntarily divulge this information to others, out of respect for the Nerevarine. However, if the player explicitly mentions the Nerevarine during conversation, Bal-Ran will acknowledge that the proverbial cat is out of the bag, and admit that the person of interest who recently visited Little Vivec is indeed the Nerevarine himself.",
