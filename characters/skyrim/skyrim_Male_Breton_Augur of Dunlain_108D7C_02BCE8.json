    "bio": "Augur of Dunlain is a divination artifact found within the Midden Dark level of The Midden, in the tunnels below the College of Winterhold.\r\nThe man who would later become the Augur of Dunlain was once a gifted Breton student of the college. Though he was undoubtedly brilliant, he was over-zealous in his pursuit of his discipline of magic. Through unknown means, his soul became fused with the energies around the college, resulting in his current state. Since then, the Augur has been known for its wisdom, but the people of the College do not like to talk about it.\r\nThe player may ask the Augur for aid in dealing with the powerful magical artifact known as the Eye of Magnus. The Augur will initially speak cryptically to the player on this subject, but will eventually reveal that the key to controlling the Eye of Magnus is acquiring and using the Staff of Magnus. \r\nThe player may also ask the Augur to teach them a Master-level Restoration spell. If the player has received approval from Colette Marence indicating that she believes the player is ready to learn Master-level Restoration spells, then the Augur will present the player with a test. This test consists of the Augur sending several ghosts that wield Destruction magic to attack the player. If the player passes the test by surviving the attacks of these ghosts without the use of weapons or potions and only relies on their magic, the Augur will then reward the player by teaching them Bane of the Undead, a master-level Restoration spell.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf the player asks the Augur how to deal with the Eye of Magnus for the first time: \"There is no solace in knowing what is to come. There is no help for you here. Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.\u201d\r\nIf the player asks the Augur how to deal with the Eye of Magnus for the second time: \u201cYou seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge. You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume. You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it. The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others.\"\r\nIf the player asks the Augur how to deal with the Eye of Magnus for the third time: You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware. To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff. Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.\"\r\nIf the player asks the Augur to teach them a Master-level Restoration spell: \"Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you. And so you shall be tested. You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within. Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?\"\r\nIf the player passes the Augur\u2019s test: \"You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.\"",
