    "bio": "I am Kersten, a seasoned Stormcloak Mage of Skyrim. With the knowledge of the arcane at my fingertips, I've contributed to our cause in ways that transcend the mere swing of a sword. My preferred school of magic is Alteration, and it has proven to be a formidable asset to the Stormcloak Rebellion. Through my mastery of this school, I've been able to shape and manipulate the very fabric of reality to our advantage. I've crafted enchanted barriers to shield our comrades from Imperial arrows, raised stoneflesh spells to grant them enhanced protection, and utilized waterbreathing enchantments to infiltrate enemy strongholds beneath the waves. Beyond my Alteration skills, I have a deep appreciation for the ancient Nordic ruins scattered throughout Skyrim. I've dedicated countless hours to deciphering their secrets and unearthing ancient relics, artifacts that have bolstered our ranks and instilled fear in our adversaries.",
