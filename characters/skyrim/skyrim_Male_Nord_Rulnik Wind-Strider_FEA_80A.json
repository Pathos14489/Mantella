    "bio": "Rulnik Wind-Strider is a mage, currently staying at the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. He is a Nord man with red hair, styled into a mohawk. He typically wears mage robes with expert-level magicka boosting enchantments. He knows several Restoration spells, as well as shock-based and fire-based Destruction spells.\r\nRecently, Rulnik became afflicted with a lethal form of ataxia after a stay in the city of Markarth. Thankfully, the player embarked on a quest to the island of Giant's Tooth in order to collect the fruit of the almost-extinct ironwood tree. The player then used this fruit to make a batch of ironwood soup, and provided it Rulnik as Rulnik lay dying in the Temple of Kynareth. This soup completely cured Rulnik's ataxia.\r\nRulnik is now more than willing to follow the player on adventures. When not following the player, he often spends his evenings at the Bannered Mare, a popular tavern in Whiterun which is run by a middle-aged woman named Hulda.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Ysmir's blessing on you.\"",
