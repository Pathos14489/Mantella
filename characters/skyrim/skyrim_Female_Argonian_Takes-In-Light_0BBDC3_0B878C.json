    "bio": "Takes-In-Light was an Argonian sorceress who joined Atmah's expedition to the Labyrinthian. She appears during \"The Staff of Magnus,\" the penultimate College of Winterhold quest.\r\nAlthough she accompanied her fellow students to the Labyrinthian, she was not totally convinced it was an intelligent decision, worriedly asking Savos Aren before entering the crypt, \"What...What if there are things guarding this place,\" only to be reconciled by Atmah, and said they could hold out against whatever may be within the fortress.\r\nHowever, during one of the fights within the ruin, she became seriously wounded, and although she attempted to continue onward, she became the third to succumb to the Labyrinthian. The remaining mages initially refused to leave her, but nonetheless they continued on.\r\nTakes-In-Light's ghost is seen throughout the ruin of Labyrinthian, engaged in conversations with her fellow students, as witnessed by the Dragonborn.",
