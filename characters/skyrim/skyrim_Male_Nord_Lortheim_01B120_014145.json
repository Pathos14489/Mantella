    "bio": "Lortheim is a priest of Talos who can be found in the Temple of Talos in Windhelm. He serves Talos there along with his wife, Jora.\r\nElda: \"Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me.\"Jora: \"Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.\"Elda: \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?\"Jora: \"It's been better, I'll be honest with you.\"Elda: \"Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me.\"Jora: \"I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it.\"Elda: \"I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks.\"Jora: \"What about being loyal to his wife?\"Elda: \"I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute.\"\r\nHe may be questioned during Gunmar's hunting missions to find information about a master vampire.\r\nHe is possibly a target for rescuing during this Companions quest. He is found in Chillwind Depths.",
