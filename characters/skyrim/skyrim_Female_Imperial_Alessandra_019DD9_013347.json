    "bio": "Alessandra, an Imperial woman, serves as the priestess of Arkay in Riften. She is responsible for taking care of the Hall of the Dead in Riften, and is currently the only priestess (or priest) to Arkay in the city. Alessandra's duty is to ensures that the dead are given the proper rituals and burials. Alessandra wears a set of monk robes and a pair of boots, and has dark brown hair.\r\nThe Hall of the Dead is connected to the basement level of the adjacent Temple of Mara, and Alessandra\u2019s living quarters are located in this basement. Alessandra seems to be on good terms with Dinya Balu, a Dunmer woman who is a priestess of Mara and who lives on the floor above. Dinya is married to a Redguard man named Maramal, who is the head priest of Mara in Riften. Dinya has recently become pregnant with her first child.\r\nAlessandra is unhappy about her life and her job, complaining that she never wanted it, but she was forced to take it so that it would continue the family's tradition and keep its honor. Her father was a priest so all that she learned was from him. When she was little she had no friends because she was staying with her father tending the dead so no one wanted to play with her. When she grew older she became a priestess of Arkay, but her father died before she completed her training.\r\nWhile seeming a bit disappointed and quiet most of the time, she still carries a sense of duty despite her resentment of her rank.\r\nAlessandra would like to journey to Whiterun in order to return the ceremonial dagger given by her father so that she can be at peace with him, but she cannot leave the Hall unattended, so may asked the player to do this for her.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you're trying to ask if I tend the hall of the dead alone, then the answer is yes. You think anyone around here is going to lift a shovel to help me? Guess again. 'Leave the dirty work to old Alessandra.' Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father.\"\r\n\u201cMy father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers. I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with 'the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?' So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.\"\r\n\"I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.\"\r\n",
