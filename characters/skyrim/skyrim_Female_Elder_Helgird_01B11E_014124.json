She tells them that the victim Susanna's coinpurse was still intact, which means she was not killed for gold. She takes the corpse into the Hall of the Dead to prepare it for burial. She then tells the Dragonborn that the slash marks on the victim's body were from a curved blade used by the Nords for embalming the dead.",
