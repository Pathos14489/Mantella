    "bio": "Aicantar is an young Altmer who lives inside Understone Keep in Markarth. Understone Keep is an ancient Dwemer structure built into the mountainside, used as a palace by the jarl of Markarth. Aicantar helps his uncle Calcelmo in his work area (complete with enchanter and alchemy tables), which is in a large cavernous chamber in the keep, filled with stone columns, pillars, and other hallmarks of ancient Dwemer architecture. Across the underground river from this work area is an entrance to Nchuand-Zel, an ancient Dwemer ruin located deep within the mountain. Excavation efforts in Nchuand-Zel were recently thwarted by the presence of Nimhe, a giant frostbite spider.\r\nAicantar is a talented conjurer. From ancient Dwemer components, he has constructed a working mechanical \"spider\" - a many-legged Dwemer autonomous machine. This \"spider\" has been modified so that it can be controlled via a control rod, which Aicantar also constructed. Aicantar will not openly talk about this invention, as it is still somewhat of a secret.\r\nAicantar's is somewhat saddened that his uncle Calcelmo doesn't appear to care about him very much. For as long as Aicantar has known him, Calcelmo has only truly cared about his scholarly work. To his credit, Calcelmo is indeed a preeminent scholar of the ancient Dwemer (as well as the Falmer), and has published notable works on the subject. Calcelmo also curates an impresive private Dwemer Museum inside the keep. The only exception to the restlessness of Calcemo's obsession with the ancient past seems to be Calcelmo's eye for Faleen, a Redguard woman who serves as Jarl Igmund's personal housecarl.\r\nAicantar has been trying to convince his uncle to allow him to forego participating in the upcoming planned archaeological excavation. Aicantar would rather not have to endure another one of these excavations. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cDon't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.\"\r\n\"I'm afraid to touch half of the things they keep in the tower.\"\r\n\"I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.\"\r\n\"I try not to think how my uncle got all those Dwemer Centurion parts.\"",
