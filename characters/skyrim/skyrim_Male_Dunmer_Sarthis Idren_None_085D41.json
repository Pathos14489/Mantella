    "bio": "Sarthis Idren is a Dunmer skooma producer and dealer operating out of the warehouse in Riften.\r\nThe Dragonborn learns from Wujeeta, a skooma addict working at the Riften Fishery, that Sarthis is producing and dealing skooma out of the warehouse. After informing Jarl Laila Law-Giver or Maven Black-Briar of this, she sends the Dragonborn to kill Sarthis and gather information on his operation.\r\nUpon entering the warehouse, the Dragonborn will find Sarthis and his bodyguard, Orini Dral. If the Dragonborn is detected, they will become hostile and attack. Once they are dead, a search in the basement will uncover Sarthis' satchel, which contains a small amount of gold and a note titled Shipment's Ready. The note identifies both where and from whom Sarthis is acquiring the skooma.\r\nOnce the note has been delivered to either Jarl Laila or Maven, she will send the Dragonborn to Cragslane Cavern to eliminate the supplier and put an end to the operation.",
