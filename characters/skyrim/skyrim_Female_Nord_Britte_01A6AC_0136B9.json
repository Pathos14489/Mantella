    "bio": "Britte is a child who lives in the farming village of Rorikstead. She and her identical twin sister Sissel can often be found running around the village. Their father Lemkil often complains about how little they help him with his farm. Their mother died while giving birth to her and Sissel. Britte is often beaten by her abusive father, who insults her and says she is good for nothing. In turn, Britte can be rather cruel to her sister Sissel, often taunting and bullying her.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.\"\r\n\"If you beat up my sister, Sissel, I won't tell.\"\r\n\"I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow.\"",
