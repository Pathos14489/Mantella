    "bio": "Aia Arria lives in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim. She is a student at the Bards College. She is an Imperial. As a bard, she sings and plays both the flute and the lute. At night, she sleeps in her small room in the basement of the Bards College.\r\nAccording to Pantea Ateia, Aia is the only current student at the Bards College with actual talent.\r\nAia is quite confident about her skills as a bard. She has a distaste for many of the other members of the Bards College. Some of her fellow classmates include an adolescent Redguard man named Ataf, an adolescent Nord woman named Illdi, and a Nord man named Jorn. Her teachers include a Breton man named Giraud Gemane (Dean of History), and elderly Nord woman named Inge Six Fingers (Dean of Lute), an Imperial woman named Pantea Ateia, and an Altmer named Viaramo (he's the Headmaster of the college).\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.\"\r\n\"Lady Ateia says my voice is second only to hers. But she's selling me short.\"\r\n\"Few can resist my charms. Even fewer are worthy of them.\"\r\n\u201cPoetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.\"\r\n\u201cMusic tames the most savage beasts. Even Nords.\"\r\n\"You know, my father collected exotic alcohols: rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall, and the like. None of what he collected tasted as good as Evette's Spiced Wine.\u201d\r\n\u201cPerfection takes dedication.\u201d\r\n\"I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music.\"\r\n\"Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should.\"\r\n\u201cLady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath, after I graduate.\"\r\nWhen discussing the performances of her fellow classmates: \"As long as they're playing instruments they're passable. You don't want to hear them sing.\"",
