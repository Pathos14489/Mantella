    "bio": "Clario is an experimental chef who cooks with alchemy and magic. He can be found at the Understone Keep and the Silver-Blood Inn, where he interacts with the Dibellan priestess, Jolene. As a traditional Breton, his accent, manner of speech, and character are heavily influenced by French cuisine and culture, particularly the Gourmet\u2019s signature dish \u201cPotage Le Magnifique.\u201d He harbours a bit of jealousy and anger toward the Gourmet, whose more pedestrian dishes have garnered far more acclaim.The book Mortar, Pestle, and Pot, written by Clario\u2019s assistant, can be found in the Understone Keep kitchen, atop a crate. Clario\u2019s accent implies he was raised in the same region where the Gourmet trained. Ironically, while the Gourmet is the outsider, it is Clario\u2019s cooking that is more experimental, although this could be a product of his failure to surpass the Gourmet\u2019s potage.",
