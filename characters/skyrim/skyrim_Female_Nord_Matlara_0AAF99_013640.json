She and her husband Torolf were killed when a terrible black dragon attacked Helgen, breathing fire and raining down meteors from the sky. The dragon attacked after General Tullius, the Imperial military governor of Skyrim, began executing Stormcloak rebel prisoners within the town's square. Luckily, Matlara and Torolf's 11-year old son Haming was able to escape Helgen's destruction and survive.",
