    "bio": "Drifa is a Nord pawnbroker in Riften. She is\u00a0the wife of Bersi Honey-Hand and co-owner of The Pawned Prawn.\r\nShe spends most of the day inside of the store with her husband. She occasionally walks about the Riften marketplace. Be it outside of the store or inside, Drifa provides no services or dialogue options. When she is inside the store with her husband, they will make idle banter. She is also known to be an avid follower of Mara. Dialogue with her husband, Bersi Honey-Hand, suggests that she has been appropriating business expenses to pay for skooma, a bottle of which can be found underneath the couple's bed.\r\nBersi: \"Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for \"spices.\" Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?\" Drifa: \"Spices? I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about.\" Bersi: \"You sure? It was in your hand writing. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.\" Drifa: [with a slight tremble in her voice] \"Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear.\"\r\nDrifa: \"You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?\" Bersi: \"What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?\" Drifa: \"You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...\" Bersi: \"Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves.\"",
