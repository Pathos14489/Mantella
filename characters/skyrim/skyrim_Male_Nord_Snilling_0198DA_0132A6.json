His wife will say that she does not mind doing the farming, as Snilling would only hurt himself and she leaves him to do the house chores inside.\r\nSnilling: \"It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear.\" Snilling: \"I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm.\"",
