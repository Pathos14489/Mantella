What started this?\" Lond: \"You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?\"\r\nLond: \"Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.\" Leigelf: \"It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.\" Lond: \"I'll, uh, just take that as a compliment.\"",
