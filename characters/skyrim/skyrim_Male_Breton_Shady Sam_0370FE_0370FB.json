Some call him \"Shady Sam\".\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nSam sells a wide variety of potions. He also secretly sells skooma, a notorious illegal narcotic drug. He usually wears black hooded robes. On evenings, he can often be found in the Windpeak Inn, a popular local tavern run by a man named Thoring.",
