    "bio": "Red Eagle, also known as Faolan in Old Reach native language, was a legendary hero of the Reachmen, who despite being forsaken and exiled by the ruling elders of his people, managed to defend the Reach from legions of the Alessian Empire until Empress Hestra mobilized a force \"unlike any before.\"\r\nRed Eagle was born in the Sundered Hills, deep within The Reach, around 1E 1030. As a boy, the village priests foresaw his destiny. He was to become a great warrior and leader, who would unite and lead the ten warring kings who ruled the Reach at the time. As the years passed, Red Eagle grew in power and influence and became a prosperous and well known leader.\r\nAround 1E 1055, Hestra, Empress of Cyrodiil, attempted an invasion of The Reach. The old kings resisted, but were either killed or bribed to fall under the banner of the Alessian Empire. Eventually, Hestra's legions arrived at Sundered Hills and envoys were sent to bargain for their surrender.\r\nRed Eagle refused to yield the freedom of his people, but the elders were afraid, cast him out, and accepted the Imperial yoke.\r\nDespite his expulsion from Sundered Hills, Red Eagle still held great influence among his people. He gathered Reachmen loyal to himself and his belief that the Reach should be free from Imperial oppression. Together they formed a resistance and successfully carried out raids on the seemingly endless number of Imperial patrols and garrisons throughout The Reach.\r\nOne night Red Eagle was approached by a cloaked stranger who revealed herself to be a Hagraven. She offered him power, for a price. Red Eagle agreed to the pact and sacrificed his heart, his will and his humanity to become a Briarheart. The Reachmen are allied with Molag Bal, but it is not known if his deal was with the lord of discord specifically. Nevertheless, from that day forth, his was a spirit of vengeance; he was pitiless and beyond remorse. The Reachmen resistance grew in strength and numbers, and within two years Red Eagle managed to drive the Imperial Legions from The Reach.\r\nDespite Red Eagle's initial victory, Empress Hestra returned to The Reach with an army unlike any before. For two weeks Hestra's generals laid siege to Red Eagle's stronghold until he emerged, alone and robed in nothing but his flaming sword. It was said that he fought well into the night and slaughtered a thousand Imperials before he was slain. His kin buried his body in Rebel's Cairn, a hidden tomb deep within the rock.\r\nAccording to legend, he presented his legendary sword to his people, and swore an oath: Fight on, and when at last The Reach was free, his blade should be returned to his tomb so that he might rise and lead them again.\r\nIn the Fourth Era, the descendants of the Reachmen, the Forsworn, draw several parallels to the struggles of Red Eagle and his oppression under an occupying force. As such, many of them extol the teachings and practices of Red Eagle and look up to him as a paragon. Indeed, the Sundered Towers became a stronghold for the Forsworn and Red Eagle's Fury was even wielded by their Briarheart leader. This leader was slain by the Dragonborn and the sword was claimed. It was then used to open Red Eagle's tomb and the undead Reachman was defeated. His sword then became Red Eagle's Bane.\r\nRed Eagle can be encountered in Rebel's Cairn at the conclusion of this quest, which is initiated by reading the book The Legend of Red Eagle.\r\nApproaching the coffin at the back of the room will cause Red Eagle to rise up along with four skeletal archers at different points around the room.\r\nRed Eagle wields a unique Nordic sword called Red Eagle's Fury.",
