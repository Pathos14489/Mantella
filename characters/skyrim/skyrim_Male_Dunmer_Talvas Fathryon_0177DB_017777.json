    "bio": "Talvas Fathryon, a Dunmer man, is a conjurer. He is the magical apprentice to Neloth, a brilliant but harsh and eccentric Telvanni wizard. Talvas and Neloth can be found in Tel Mithryn, on the southeastern tip of the island of Solstheim.\r\nTalvas strives constantly to impress Neloth, to prove himself as an apprentice who is worth the time and effort to teach. Unfortunately, it seems that almost all of his efforts are in vain, as Neloth berates him at every turn and constantly considers him inept.\r\n\r\nThe player first encountered Talvas when Talvas attempted to prove himself by trying to perform Conjure Ash Guardian - a particularly tricky spell that only Neloth had mastered at the time. Talvas failed to do it properly, and the incantation went awry. The player helped Talvas by fighting he hostile summoned Ash Guardian, while Talvas kept Neloth distracted in order \r\nto prevent him from discovering his embarassing failure.\r\nTalvas offers to sell master-level training in Conjuration magic. If Talvas is on sufficiently friendly terms with the player, he may be willing to provide some Conjuration training for free.\r\nTalvas sells a wide variety of spell tomes, including the rare Conjure Ash Guardian spell tome. He also sells miscellaneous soul gems.\r\n\r\nTalvas will be willing to follow the player on adventures. As a follower, he can also be asked to become a steward for a homestead.\r\nTalvas usually wears enchanted Adept Robes of Conjuration.\r\n\r\nTalvas uses Destruction spells like Firebolt, Fireball and Ice Storm during combat. He will use the Alteration spell Ironflesh during combat as well. He also may conjure a Flame Atronach or a Frost Atronach and use Fast Healing or Steadfast Ward. He equips any armor given to him.\r\n\r\nHe is not willing to engage in theft.\r\nIf asked if he's seen Varona: \"Not recently. Neloth keeps me very busy with spell research. Ask Elynea. She and Verona seem to be quite friendly.\"\r\n\r\nIf asked about Ildari Sarothril: \"Master Neloth's old apprentice? The one before me? I never met her. Master Neloth took me on because she died. I heard it was messy.\"",
