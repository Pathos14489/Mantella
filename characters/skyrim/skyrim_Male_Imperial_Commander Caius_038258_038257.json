    "bio": "Commander Caius is a middle-aged Imperial man. He is the captain of the guard in the city of Whiterun, where he resides. His boss is Jarl Balgruuf (a Nord man), the leader of Whiterun. Caius is loyal to the Empire and heavily supports the Imperial Legion over the Stormcloak rebels in the Skyrim Civil War. Caius wears a set of Whiterun Guard armor and a pair of fur boots. He is equipped with a high quality sword. He is balding, clean-shaven, and has brown hair at the sides of his head.\r\nCertain citizens of Whiterun are very vocal about their negative opinions of Commander Caius. A prominent Nord man named Sinmir has no qualms about publicly claiming that Caius is extremely incompetent. Sinmir says that he could do Caius' job better even while being blindfolded.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks capture Whiterun, then Jarl Balgruuf, Balgruuf\u2019s housecarl Irileth (a Dunmer woman), Balgruuf\u2019s young brother Hrongar, and Balgruuf\u2019s steward Proventus Avenicci (a middle-aged Imperial man) will be forced to seek refuge at the Blue Palace in the city of Solitude. Jarl Elisif the Fair (a young Nord woman), the leader of Solitude, supports the Empire and the Imperial Legion against the Stormcloaks. If the Stormcloaks capture Whiterun, Caius may be forced into exile at the Blue Palace along with Jarl Balgruuf and his entourage. However, he may also be allowed to stay within Whiterun, despite being stripped of his position by the conquering Stormcloaks. At that point, Sinmir will replace Caius as captain of the guard. If this happens, Caius will spend most of his time at the Bannered Mare, drinking his sorrows away. The Bannered Mare is a popular inn in Whiterun which is owned and operated by Hulda, a middle-aged Nord woman.\r\nIf Caius finds himself in Honningbrew Meadery outside of Whiterun, he is likely there to arrest Sabjorn (the Nord man who owns and runs this meadery) and take him to the Dragonsreach Dungeon in Whiterun. Sabjorn\u2019s crime is allowing poor sanitary conditions (like skeever infestation) within the Honningbrew Meadery. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cI'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.\u201d\r\n\u201cMy boys will keep you safe. Don't you worry.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness.\u201d\r\n\"Yes? What is it?\"\r\nIf either in the Blue Palace, or the Bannered Mare: \u201cI'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power. The Legion will regain control of the city. Mark my words.\u201d",
