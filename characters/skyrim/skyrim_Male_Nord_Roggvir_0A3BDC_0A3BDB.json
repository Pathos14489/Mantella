    "bio": "Roggvir is a city guard who lives in Solitude, having been born and growing up here. Solitude is the capital of Haafingar hold, as well as the provincial capital of Skyrim as a whole.\r\nRoggvir has a sister named Greta, who is now married to a local fisherman named Addvar, with whom she has a young daughter named Svari. Svari is fond of her uncle Roggvir.\r\nRoggvir was on duty at Solitude's main gate at the time of High King Torygg's death at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak. Immediately after the incident, Roggvir opened the city gate and allowed Ulfric to escape. For this supposed crime, Roggvir has been branded a traitor and sentenced to death. He is a proud Nord and Stormcloak sympathizer, defending Ulfric's actions as honorable even in the face of death.\r\nAldis, the captain of the Solitude city guard, is now presiding over Roggivr's execution. Despite considering Roggvir a fine and honorable man, Aldis nonetheless believes that Roggvir's execution sentence is appropriate. Roggvir is currently wearing simple clothing, is clean shaven, and has an amulet of Talos in his pocket.\r\nRoggvir's execution by means of the executioner's axe is now only moments away. A large crowd has gathered to watch his execution, in the square near the city's main gate. This crowd seems generally quite hostile towards Roggvir, hurling insults at him. In his defense against his alleged crime, Roggvir has just exclaimed that Ulfric challenged Torygg in single combat, and won honorably. As such, it was the way of the Nords to allow Ulfric to leave, as he had done nothing wrong and committed no murder. Roggvir's words fall on deaf ears, and the crowd is booing and shouting at him.\r\nSeconds from now, the executioner's axe will separate Roggivr's head from his body.",
