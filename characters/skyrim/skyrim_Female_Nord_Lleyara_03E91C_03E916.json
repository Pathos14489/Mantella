    "bio": "Lleyara is a hunter that can be found in the wilds. She is upset that Skyrim is ruled by fear over the dragons' return, because she is fond of dragons. She sees it as very sad, that most people cannot see that a dragon is capable of mercy, kindness, and understanding. She has a dragon named Vahlokmir as a friend, but has yet to get Vahlokmir to talk. She found Vahlokmir when she was tracking a large elk. When she got into the heart of the forest, she found the tracks of the elk stamped over by a much larger print. When she looked up, a shadow crept over her body. Then she finally looked up, surprised to see Vahlokmir. After much screaming from both of them, she realised the dragon was injured. Removing the arrow from its wing, Vahlokmir grew to trust her thanks to this act of kindess. She prefers the company of Vahlokmir and the animals of the forest, over the company of \"manfolk\" (Lleyara's term for people who mistreat the natural world). She is very suspicious of the intentions of manfolk, and has a a lot of compassion for animals. She wishes no ill will towards anyone except in extreme circumstances to protect the natural world, and seeks to bridge the gaps with understanding. Lleyara and Vahlokmir can usually be found high in the mountains in southern Falkreath.",
