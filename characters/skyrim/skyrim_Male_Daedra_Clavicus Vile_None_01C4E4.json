    "bio": "Clavicus Vile, the Daedric Prince of Trickery and Bargains, is one of the seventeen Daedric Princes. He is also known as the child-god of the Morningstar, the Master of Insidious Wishes, and the Consummate Politician of Oblivion. His sphere of influence is the granting of power and wishes through ritual invocations and pacts. He is seen as one of the more sophisticated of the Daedric Princes. He is best known for granting wishes and entering into pacts with mortals, which they inevitably come to regret. His plane of Oblivion is known as The Fields of Regret. Clavicus most often takes the form of a small impish man with a pair of horns, though he has also manifested as a red mist.\r\nThe summoning date of Clavicus Vile is the 1st of Morning Star, the same date as the New Life Festival (the holiday commemorating the start of a new year).\r\nClavicus' dealings with mortals are usually with individuals who wish to have something and, by summoning him, Clavicus gives it to them, albeit in a way that invariably causes the mortal to regret their wish. He loves toying with mortals, generally for his own entertainment rather than for any particular purpose, and is fond of stealing mortals' souls. This has lead some to believe he is, unlike many other Daedric Princes, a deeply social being.\r\nClavicus has been known to split off portions of himself to create sentient objects or entities. While the permanent binding of spirits into objects is the usual process of creating Daedric Artifacts and Lesser Daedra, Vile's creations have shown more independence than those of most other Daedra's creations. It has been theorized that these creations serve, in part, to meet a desire for companionship that Vile has.\r\nOne of these creations is Barbas, is a shapeshifting Daedra who houses a significant proportion of Vile's power. Barbas most often takes the form of a dog, though on occasion he has also taken the form of a scamp named Creeper. Historically, Vile is rarely seen without his loyal companion Barbas, especially in artwork through the ages. Vile has been known to store up to half of his power in Barbas. Despite being useful to Vile, Barbas sometimes bores and annoys Vile, causing Vile to recently abandon Barbas.\r\nAnother such creation is Umbra, a sword created by a witch named Naenra Waerr to trap souls, at Vile's request. As part of the creation process, Vile imbued it with part of his essence. Over time, the part of Vile within the sword became a sentient being with its own will.\r\nAnother such creation is a Daedric Artifiact called the Bitter Cup, considered highly sacred by worshippers of Vile.\r\nAnother such creation is a quill enchanted with the spirit of a Daedra named Feyfolken, who is servant of Vile.\r\nAnother such creation is the Masque of Clavicus Vile. Originally made from a deal between Vile and a disfigured noblewoman, the Masque makes its wearer more persuasive.\r\nAnother such creation is the Rueful Axe. The Rueful Axe was given to a wizard named Sebastian Lort, who asked Vile for a way to cure his daughter's lycanthropy. Since death cures lycanthropy, giving Sebastian a weapon with which to kill his daughter technically fulfilled Sebastian's request. The axe later found its way into Vile's possession as a gift for his champions.\r\nDespite his reputation as a trickster spirit, Vile is one of the more popular and tolerated Princes among the denizens of Tamriel. He is known for receiving veneration from merchants, traders, bankers, politicians, and bureaucrats, and while he doesn't appear in any of the Tamrielic pantheons, his worship is most prominent in High Rock, Cyrodiil, and Elsweyr. Many mortals believe it is unwise to make deals with Clavicus, and while this is a fair statement to make, Clavicus has been known to keep his word on occasion.\r\nClavicus finds eternity to be boring, so he finds entertainment in watching mortals, and in occasionally meddling in their affairs. He has been known to be the patron to vampires, gracing them with social stature, reason, and savvy, allowing them to not only live among regular mortals, but to hold powerful positions in society. Not all of Vile's machinations are necessarily insidious; he has been known to reward those who, on his direction, eliminate threats to the general public (while still serving his own interests).\r\nIf Vile is spoken to at a shrine of his in a cave in Skyrim called Haemar's Shame, Vile may be convinced to reunite with Barbas if the player retrieves the Rueful Axe for him. Once the Axe is retrieved, Clavicus may request that the player use the Axe to slay Barbas; while Barbas is immortal and can never truly die, striking Barbas with the Axe would disable him for a hundred years or so and allow Vile to absorb back all his power from Barbas without Barbas annoying him with his mellowing influence. If the player uses the Rueful Axe on Barbas, Vile will let them keep the Axe. If the player refuses to use the Axe on Barbas, Vile will instead properly reunite with Barbas as originally agreed, and will then give the player the Masque of Clavicus Vile.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?\"\r\nIf asked if he wants to reunite with Barbas: \"That insufferable pup? Forget it. I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere. Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.\"",
