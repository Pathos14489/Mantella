    "bio": "I am Shyvana, a mage whose affinity for lightning magic once drew me to the hallowed halls of the College of Winterhold. However, my tenure there was short-lived, as the rigid structure and stifling traditions clashed with my nature. Too much focus on books and too little focus on learning to use our power in the real world. Once I left, my heart found its true calling amidst the Dwemer ruins that dot Skyrim's landscape. There's an irresistible allure in these ancient, mysterious places, where the secrets of a long-lost civilization are waiting to be unraveled. The Dwemer's intricate machinery and enigmatic devices hold a certain seductive charm for me, akin to the dance of lightning in the night sky. Within the depths of these ruins, I am free to experiment with my lightning magic, and the electric arcs that illuminate the darkness are like a siren's call. Dwemer automatons become my unwitting test subjects, and with each discharge of power, I inch closer to understanding the arcane secrets left behind by these enigmatic engineers.",
