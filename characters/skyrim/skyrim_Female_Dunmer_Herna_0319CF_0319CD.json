    "bio": "Herna lives in the Gray Quarter of Windhelm, where she works as a barmaid at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. In Dunmer culture, a cornerclub is analogous to an inn/tavern. This cornerclub is run by Ambarys Rendar and his subordinate, Malthyr Elenil. Like the vast majority of the Gray Quarter's population, everyone who works at this cornerclub is a Dunmer. Most of their customers are Dunmer, though a few Altmer women (Arivanya and Niranye) are also regular patrons there.\r\nAmbarys is quite vocal about his disdain for the native Nord population of Windhelm. Malthyr also often voices his frustrations regarding the Nords' discrimination against the city's Dunmer refugee population. Many Dunmer immigrated to Skyrim (to Windhelm in particular, given its relative proximity to Morrowind) as a result of the destruction caused by the volcanic eruption of Red Mountain on Morrowind's central island of Vvardenfell, almost 200 years ago.\r\nThe cornerclub offers traditional Dunmer alchoholic drinks such sujamma, shein, flin, and mazte, as well as meads, wines, and various food options.\r\nHerna's barmaid coworker is a younger woman named Mery.\r\nHerna has bright redeyes and red hair. She usually clothing typical of a female barkeeper. When working, Herna walks around the cornerclub serving drinks and food.",
