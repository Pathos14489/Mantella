    "bio": "Hrefna is a Nord child living in Darkwater Crossing.\r\nShe is the daughter of Tormir. When Tormir is not around, Sondas Drenim takes care of her. She walks around Goldenrock Mine during the day, carrying a pickaxe, but she rarely uses it.\r\nWhen Derkeethus is missing, she admits she misses him. If and when he returns, she will say that she goes swimming with him in the river every now and then.\r\nIt appears that she does not like the Stormcloak rebellion, despite her family's support of it.\r\nShe mentions an elf named Meieran (which does not appear in the game) in conversations, suggesting that he is quite friendly with her, and that he teaches her many things.",
