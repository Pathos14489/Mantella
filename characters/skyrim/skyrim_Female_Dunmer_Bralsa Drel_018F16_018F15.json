    "bio": "Bralsa Drel, a Dunmer woman, is a miner originally encountered at the Earth Stone, outside Raven Rock. When initially encountered, she is constantly working on the structure around the Earth Stone; she talks and acts like she has been indoctrinated, just like the other people around the stone.\r\nSeveral years ago she was a very successful ebony miner, so much so that she was said to be wealthier than the Councilor Morvayn himself. However, when the ebony mines closed she knew no other trade and turned to drinking to drown her sorrows. She lost all her money and was reduced to a beggar.\r\nAfter being freed from her indoctrination, she will return to the Abandoned Building in Raven Rock with Rirns Llervu.\r\nShe later explains that Geldis Sadri has banned her from drinking at the The Retching Netch and asks if the player can somehow persuade him to let her back in. If she is allowed back she will be very thankful and reward the player with a gift she once carried in happier times.\r\nIf the ebony mines have been reopened at the conclusion of the quest, she finds a job working there and things will begin looking up for her as she mentions it.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I was one of the wealthiest miners in town... I could haul up almost three or four times what the average digger could. I never saw the end coming like it did... the mine running out of ebony. Unlike most of my fellow miners, I was too foolish to save enough coin for that day. The rest I spent on sujamma to drown my sorrows. Councilor Morvayn was kind enough to allow Rirns and I to live in one of the abandoned buildings. At least it keeps the ash out of our eyes.\"\r\nIf the ebony mine re-opens: \"Things couldn't be better. The sections that are being opened up have revealed some huge deposits of ebony. Old Crescius has a nose for exactly where to dig. If they'd only listened to him years ago, the town wouldn't have been in such dire straits. At this rate, I'll be able to put a roof over my head in just a few months.\"\r\nIf offered a free sample of Geldis Sadri's new sujamma drink: \"The day I refuse sujamma from Geldis is the day I sprout wings and fly off of this rock.\"\r\n",
