    "bio": "Movarth Piquine is an ancient master vampire. He leads a coven of vampires from his lair, a cave deep within the marshes of Hjaalmarch.\r\nIn the Second Era, many centuries ago, Movarth lived as a normal human and was a prominent member and instructor in the Fighters Guild, specializing in unarmed combat. Suffering and anguish had marked him early in his life, marring facial features which would have otherwise been handsome. Movarth later ceased teaching and became an accomplished vampire hunter. Movarth eventually sought the expertise of a chapel priest who was known to be an expert on vampires. Over a period of time, this priest consistently provided Movarth with knowledge that proved useful during Movarth's hunts of vampires of the Volkihar clan in Skyrim, as well as against the various clans of vampires in Valenwood. Movarth was determined to slay vampires within every province of Tamriel. However, his quest was cut short when one day, the priest revealed his vampiric nature and attacked Movarth, turning him into a vampire. The entire time, the priest had secretly been a vampire of the Cyrodiil Vampyrum Order, who are able to conceal the outward symptoms of their vampirism via regularly feeding on blood. The priest later anonymously published the story of his interactions with Movarth within a section of \"Immortal Blood\", a book about vampires that is still popular despite being centuries old.\r\nIn combat, Movarth attacks with both Shock and Frost spells, and is also skilled with unarmed combat and one-handed swords. He is extremely powerful, and is capable of healing himself rapidly with his powerful vampiric life drain spell. He has pale white skin, and is bald.\r\nMany centuries have passed since Movarth was turned into an immortal vampire. He is now the leader of a coven of vampires in Skyrim, living with his vampire followers and thralls in his cave lair located north of Morthal.\r\nMovarth is now masterminding a hostile takeover of the entire town of Morthal, the capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Movarth recently sent a local Nord woman named Alva (whom Movarth has turned into a vampire and made his thrall) to seduce Morthal's guards and turn them into vampiric thralls. After Alva finishes carrying out this plan, Movarth plans to wrangle up the townsfolk of Morthal and exploit them as blood cattle.\r\nUnfortunately, Alva's careless lack of subtlety during her mission has raised the suspicion of Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone, the ruler of Hjaalmarch who lives in Morthal. She (the jarl) has hired an adventurer to investigate the matter. This adventurer (the player) has now uncovered Alva's secret vampiric identity and has discovered the location of Movarth's secret lair. Movarth is now within the throne room of his lair, surrounded by his vampire followers and thralls.",
