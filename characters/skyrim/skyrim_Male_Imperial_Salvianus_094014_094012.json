    "bio": "Salvianus is a mentally deranged Imperial soldier, which can be found hidden away in the Ratway Warrens deep beneath Riften.\r\nOn Salvianus' table is an Imperial Officer's Helmet which, when coupled with his name, the fact that he wears Imperial Light Boots, wields an Imperial Sword, has a set of Imperial Armor, and Imperial Bracers implies that he is a former officer in the Legion.\r\nListening to his quotes, it appears that Salvianus is a veteran of the Great War and was present during the Aldmeri Dominion's siege and capture of the Imperial City between 4E 173 and 174. His reference to the medal he once had indicates that he was rewarded for his service in the Legion, but simultaneously, he wishes above all else to forget circumstances during which he earned the medal.",
