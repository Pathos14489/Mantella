    "bio": "Captain Velehk Sain, also called \"the Pirate King of the Abecean\" is a Dremora who practiced piracy in the Abecean Sea. In 4E 201, he can be found trapped in the Midden Dark after a tragedy involving four students of the College of Winterhold: Katarina, Treoy, Balwen, and Pithiken, who died from lethal cases of \"Conjurer's burn\" for attempting a summon they could not handle. Velehk Sain and his crew are merciless, cruel pirates, and going against them would be suicidal. Their ship's presence was rumored to cause madness.\r\nUpon meeting, he informs the player that the Daedric Relic is part of a binding spell holding him in Mundus. He claims to belong on a ship in the Abecean Sea and wants the player to release him in exchange for wealth. This wealth comes from an Imperial Galleon, which he needed to stash away while traveling. He wields two scimitars, and wears the type of clothing one most often sees in the province of Hammerfell.\r\nReleasing Velehk Sain offersthe player the opportunity to find his buried treasure, only visible upon proximity.\r\n If the decision is made to release him, Velehk Sain will provide a map to his treasure. The treasure will not appear until he has been encountered, nor will it appear if he is not freed by the player.",
