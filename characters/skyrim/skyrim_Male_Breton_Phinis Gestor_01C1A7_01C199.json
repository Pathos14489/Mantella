    "bio": "Phinis Gestor is a prominent member of College of Winterhold, and its resident expert on Conjuration magic. The College of Winterhold is the primary institution of magical learning in Skyrim.\r\nPhinis is a middle-aged Breton man with balding brown hair. He usually wears master-level enchanted robes of Conjuration, befitting his specialization. His quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, the main living and sleeping quarters for most of the higher ranked mages. He spends much of his time in the Arcanaeum, the College's vast library up in the central tower.\r\nPhinis is willing to sell private training lessons in Conjuration magic. He sells a variety of tomes from which Conjuration spells can be learned. He also sells mage apparel, robes and other clothing items imbued with enchantments that fortify the user's powers of Restoration and Magicka.\r\nPhinis is a former pupil of a Redguard man named Falion, who used to teach and study at the College but has since decided to live in seclusion in the town of Morthal within the swamps of Hjaalmarch. Falion has delved deep into ancient secrets involving vampirism, the Dwemer, and other esoteric matters, and has mastered Conjuration magic to a level even beyond Phinis' expertise.\r\nA Dunmer man named Savos Aren is the Arch-Mage of the College, and a Breton woman named Mirabelle Ervine serves as Master Wizard - the Arch-Mage's second-in-command.\r\nPhinis Gestor sometimes delivers lectures on the Eye of Magnus, and the College's efforts to learn more about it. These lectures are held in the Hall of the Elements, during which most of the members of the College come to listen.\r\nIf the player has sufficiently demonstrated a mastery of Conjuration magic, Phinis may teach them a spell to summon and command an unbound Dremora, and recommend that they cast this spell from a specially prepared location on the roof of one of the College's towers. This Dremora can be commanded to retrieve a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate within the daedric realm of Oblivion. Phinis will then use this sigil stone to inscribe very advanced Conjuration spells, which the player will then have the opportunity to learn. Phinis will then return the sigil stone to the player.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use...\"\r\n\"The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.\"\r\n\"That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding. No matter what the guards claim.\"\r\n\"There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.\"\r\n\"I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?\"\r\n\"Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly. Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago.\"\r\n\"Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold. Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals.\"\r\n\"Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from The Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them. If this is impossible due to misuse or accident, Urag recommends finding a replacement copy to deliver to the Arcanaeum.\"\r\n\"Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of apprentices would be greatly appreciated. As of yet, there has been no sign of them.\"\r\nIf asked why Falion left the College: \"He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him. Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it. I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem.\"\r\nIf asked for Conjuration magic training: \"I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful.\"\r\nIf asked if summonining undead is frowned upon: \"By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here. Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used. Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it.\"",
