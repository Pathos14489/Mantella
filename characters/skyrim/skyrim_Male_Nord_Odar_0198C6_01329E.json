    "bio": "Odar lives at the Blue Palace in the city of Solitude, where he works as a cook. He is very skilled at his profession.\r\nHe is a Nord man with dark brown shoulder-length hair. He typically wears a chef's tunic and chef's hat. At night, he sleeps in the chambers behind the kitchen, along with the rest of the palace staff. The kitchen and adjacent storage spaces have a vast amount of food and ingredients available for Odar to use. Odar runs the kitchen with the general help of Una and Erdi, the two servant girls. Una is a bit older than Erdi. These two women don't quite get along with each other.\r\nSolitude is the capital of Haafingar hold, as well as the provincial capital over all of Skyrim. Jarl Elisif the Fair has been the ruler of Haafingar ever since her husband King Torygg was killed by Ulfric Stormcloak. While Odar is content to remain a cook, his humble profession allows him to overhear a great deal of rumors, including gossip about the public's lack of faith in Jarl Elisif's ability to rule.\r\nOdar sometimes visits the Bards College in Solitude, where he sometimes converses with the bards there.\r\nOdar doesn't have the highest opinion of Fihada, the flamboyant Redguard man who runs the fletcher shop near Castle Dour on the other side of the city. However, Odar seems to like Jawanan (also a Redguard man), Fihada's fletching apprentice.\r\nNotable members of the Jarl's court in the Blue Palace include Falk Firebeard (man, court steward), Bryling (woman, thane), Erikur (man, thane), Bolgeir Bearclaw (man, Elisif's personal housecarl), and Sybille Stentor. Sybille is a Breton woman who has been Solitude's court mage for a long time, despite still appearing relatively young. People say that carries out twisted experiments on the prisoners in the Castle Dour dungeon.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Jarls come and Jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook.\"\r\n\"Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power in Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet.\"\r\n\"Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip.\"\r\n\"Falk's court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death. Somethin' just ain't right about her. You know I've never seen her eat a thing? That can't be natural.\"\r\nWhen finished talking with someone: \"All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking.\"",
