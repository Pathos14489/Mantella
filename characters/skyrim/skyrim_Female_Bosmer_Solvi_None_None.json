    "bio": "Solvi was once a loyal soldier for the Stormcloak faction. Trained as an archer from the time she could hold a bow in her hands, she became famous for her ability to hit targets from close or even extreme range. During her service in the Stormcloaks something happened that changed her outlook on the Stormcloaks and the war. She disappeared for a time, but when she returned rumors began to circulate about where she was during the absence. Eventually the tale was passed around Skyrim.\r\n\r\nSolvi had gone to train with a secret squad of archers known as the Heartseekers. Their purpose in Skyrim remains hidden, but it was clear that Solvi learned even more about archery from this mysterious group. She now roams Skyrim helping people in need. Rumors have surfaced that Solvi earned a heart tattoo on her face by becoming one of the most proficient Heartseekers.\r\n",
