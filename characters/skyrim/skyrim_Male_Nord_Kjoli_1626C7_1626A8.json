    "bio": "Kjoli, a Nord man, is a poet. Kjoli and his partner Inari are first encountered in the Rift, near the road south of the town of Shor\u2019s Stone on their way to the city of Riften. Inari, a Khajiit woman, is a simple farmer. Kjoli and Inari have supposedly traveled to the Rift to see its beautiful forests. However, Kjoli secretly intends for them to adopt a child from Riften during their visit, hoping it will be a nice surprise for her. Kjoli and Inari cannot conceive a child of their own because humans and Khajiit are not interfertile.\r\nKjoli and Inari met at a temple. Kjoli had come to pray, but Inari had come to commit suicide. He could not stop her in time when she made her attempt, stabbing herself through the heart. Kjoli however, was able to bandage the wound and save her life with the help of a skilled apothecary. His poetry focuses on cold and dark themes, and it brings him haunting dreams. He deeply loves Inari.",
