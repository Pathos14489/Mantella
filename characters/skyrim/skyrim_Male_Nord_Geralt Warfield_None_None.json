    "bio": "Nestled in the embrace of Riverwood, I, Geralt Warfield, transformed into a Horse ranger, my heart resonating with the spirit of animals and the great outdoors. As a ranger skilled in archery and tracking, my journey unfolded with a nocturnal challenge \u2013 a fear of the dark. Exploring the depths of the Riverwood caves, I banished the shadows that haunted my soul, becoming a ranger unafraid of the night.",
