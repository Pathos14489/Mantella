    "bio": "Zarlak, an old man, is a former Greybeard who rejects the pacifistic stance held by Arngeir and other Greybeards. Zarlak sees aggression as a tool, but one that can only be used by those who show the requisite wisdom. He is the adoptive father of Helsig (a young Nord woman) and the biological father of his son Offryn, who is a Bosmer like his mother. Helsig and Offryn are both mages. Zarlak is proud of Helsig. Zarlak and Helsig consider Offryn to be dead to them because he has chosen a dark path. They have even told Offryn's mother than he is dead and had a funeral for him, despite the fact that he technically still lives.",
