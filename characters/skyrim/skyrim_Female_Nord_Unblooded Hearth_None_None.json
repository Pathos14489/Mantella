    "bio": "I am Hearth. Less than a week ago, I chose to join the ranks of Ulfric's Stormcloaks. Born and bred in the wilds near Falkreath, my life has been a hunting story from the start. I've tracked game through the dense forests and treacherous terrain of Skyrim for as long as I can remember. One evening I came across a Talos shrine descrated by the Thalmor with the worshippers slain.  So, I decided to stand with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric, he's a true Nord who knows the importance of our lands and our freedom, and he's ready to fight for our way of life. I couldn't stand by while the Empire and them Thalmor diplomats tried to put shackles on us and stomp on our traditions. As for me, I've got a natural knack for tracking animals and reading the signs of the wilderness. It's like I can hear the heartbeat of the forest, knowing where the prey will roam. My family's been sharing this hunter's instinct for generations, and it's kept our larders full. I've already put this to good use on my first scouting mission. Another thing about me, I've got a deep reverence for Kynareth, the Goddess of the Hunt. I make offerings to her before each hunt and I plan to do the same before each scouting mission, seeking her blessings and guidance. Many say that Kynareth smiles upon me, granting me stealth and swiftness in the wilds.",
