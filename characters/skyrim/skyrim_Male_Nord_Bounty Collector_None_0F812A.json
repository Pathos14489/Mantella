    "bio": "Bounty Collector is a highly experienced and well-equipped guard who will intercept the player on the roads of Skyrim should they carry a bounty exceeding 1000 gold within a particular hold. Unlike normal guards who can only pursue criminals within the borders of a given Hold, bounty collectors are given free rein to ignore the distinction between the nine Holds of Skyrim. They have jurisdiction throughout Skyrim, regardless of the Hold in which the bounty is incurred.\r\nThey come equipped with a quality suit of heavy armor and an enchanted weapon. Under no circumstances should they be underestimated. They will approach the player and demand that they pay the bounty they have incurred for crimes they have committed. If the player cannot or will not pay their bounty for whatever reason, the bounty collector will become offended, and will subsequently become hostile and attack. The total amount which the player must pay is the gold value of the bounty was, as well as an extra 20% fee to cover administrative expenses.\r\nPaying off the bounty to the bounty collector will remove the player's criminal status, and the bounty collector will then allow them to move along.",
