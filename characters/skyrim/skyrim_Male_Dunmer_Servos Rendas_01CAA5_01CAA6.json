    "bio": "Servos Rendas\u00a0is a deceased Dunmer, and was the co-inventor, with his sister Merilar Rendas, of the magically imbued spiders that can be found all over Solstheim.\r\nHis corpse can be found locked\u00a0up in a\u00a0cage, in White Ridge Barrow, with his journal and research notes.\r\nMerilar and Servos conducted a series of experiments on Albino Spiders native to Solstheim. Through their studies, they discovered that the spiders had the ability to harness magic.\r\nUsing an imbuing chamber in White Ridge Barrow, they created several obedient sub-species, but eventually the fumes from the chamber drove Merilar to madness. According to Merilar's journal, Merilar locked Servos in a cage and eventually killed him after she feared he would take all the credit for the discovery of the spiders.",
