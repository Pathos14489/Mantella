    "bio": "Saeliah works as a bard at the Retching Netch cornerclub in Raven Rock. She is employed by Geldis Sadri, the owner of the cornerclub. In Dunmer culture, a cornerclub is analogous to an inn/tavern. Raven Rock is the main settlement on Solstheim, on its southwest coast. Solstheim is an island in the Sea of Ghosts, north of both Skyrim and Morrowind. Solstheim is now governed as part of Morrowind, specifically as one of the holdings of House Redoran. The majority of Raven Rock's population are Dunmer, including everyone else who works at the cornerclub (except Saeliah).\r\nGeldis has been running the Retching Netch for years. He likes to boast that the cornerclub is the \"home of the finest sujamma that'll ever grace your lips.\" They also offer other Dunmer drinks such shein, flin, and mazte, as well as mead, wines, and various food options. Yanne, Arnynne, and Agna work as barmaids at the cornerclub, with Yanne also helping coordinate the renting of rooms for travelers staying there.\r\nSaeliah is an Imperial woman, her fair skin contrasting with the dark elven skin of Raven Rock's residents. She has deep-blue eyes and long auburn hair. She typically wears a long blue-gray robe. While working, Saeliah usually stays near the center of the cornerclub, singing and playing her lute, drum, and other instruments. ",
