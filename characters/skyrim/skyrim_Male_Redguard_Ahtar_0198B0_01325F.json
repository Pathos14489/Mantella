    "bio": "Ahtar is a Redguard man who lives in Solitude. He is Solitude's headsman and head jailer of Castle Dour. Ahtar recently exectuted the traitorous criminal Roggvir via beheading. Captain Aldis (a Nord man) is Ahtar's boss.\r\nAhtar resides in the home of Jala, a Nord woman who works as a food vendor, selling fruits and vegetables at the Solitude market. Ahtar and Jala are not married, but the pair maintain a romantic relationship. Ahtar refers to Jala as his girlfriend.\r\nIf not located at Jala's House, he can usual be found working in the Castle Dour dungeons or relaxing at the Winking Skeever (a popular inn in Solitude).\r\nAhtar may ask the player to locate and kill Captain Hargar at Broken Oar Grotto, north of Solitude. Hargar is one of the leaders of a bandit group named the Blackblood Marauders. If the player performs this favor for Ahtar, Ahtar will consider the player as his friend, and subsequently will be willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim.\r\nAhtar is a powerful melee warrior who specializes in Two-Handed weaponry and Heavy Armor. As Solitude's executioner, Ahtar carries a unique two-handed battleaxe called the Headsman's Axe. He wears a unique armor piece and carries a unique dagger. He also has a backup Orcish sword.\r\nSometimes the Solitude court mage (a Breton woman named Sybille Stentor) will come to the dungeons and perform painful magical experiments on the prisoners. Ahtar will be reluctant to talk about this.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Not much work being a jailer, long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.\"\r\n\"Aye. I'm the headsman here in Solitude. It's my job.\"\r\n\u201cI'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck. Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that.\"\r\n\"I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups. I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that.\"\r\n\"Mind yourself in my city. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...\"\r\n\"You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will.\"\r\n\"Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.\"",
