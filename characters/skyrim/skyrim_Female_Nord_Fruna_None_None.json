While I possess a deep affinity for magic and the arcane arts, I recognized the value of complementing my mystical abilities with practical knowledge of potion-making. Hamdr's expertise in brewing elixirs and crafting remedies intrigued me. His potions often prove invaluable to adventurers, and I saw an opportunity to enhance my magical abilities by learning the art of potion-making.",
