    "bio": "Maren is the female member of a party of three Nord warriors, the others being Sven and Kjen. Maren can often be found at Robber\u2019s Refuge arguing with them. She often complains that her friends never buy the round of drinks. She has a pair of cliff racers as pets that Kjen bought her for saving his life with Svens help. Because she chose to pray at the steed stone, she has to carry all the groups loot and is getting sick of having to do it.",
