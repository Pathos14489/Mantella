    "bio": "Joselyn Fair-Child is from the town of Riverwood. She is a naturally-gifted mage. When Joselyn and her sister Zora were teenagers, Zora was known as the most beautiful girl in Riverwood. That changed when, during a sisterly fight, Joselyn slapped Zora in the face with her flame-enchanted hand, giving Zora a permanent hand-shaped burn mark in the middle of her face. Soon afterwards, Zora left Riverwood and became an adventurer.\r\nJoselyn later joined up with a coven of witches, led by an old woman named Marigoth. Joselyn eventually tried to steal a magic crystal owned by the coven, and was soon trapped within a pocket dimension inside the crystal, where she was reverted to her child form and personality.\r\nEventually, Zora and the player found this crystal in the vampire fortress of Bloodlet Throne, aided by Marigoth, who wanted her crystal back. Zora and the player freed Joselyn from the crystal (restoring her to her adult form), and then slayed Marigoth before she could harm Joselyn.\r\nJoselyn now spends her time around Riverwood, and can often be found in the Sleeping Giant Inn, run by a gruff Nord man named Orgnar.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Um...hello.  Thank you...for the other day.\"\r\n\"This town.  It never changes...\"\r\n\"Zora and I used to wash our feet in the White River, and watch the clouds over Bleak Falls.  The view is the same as it ever was.\"\r\n\"Zora says I should join the College of Winterhold.  I don't know...\"\r\n\"Keep Zora safe.\"\r\n\"Marigoth...that coven...they did horrible things.  It was a mistake to join them.\"\r\nWhen in the Sleeping Giant Inn: \"This inn is nice. Orgnar doesn't bother me. I wish the new boy would do the same.\"",
