    "bio": "Beleval, a Bosmer woman, is a vampire hunter and member of the Dawnguard.  She is the only elf (Bosmer, Dunmer, or Altmer) member of the Dawnguard, unless the player is also an elf. She has shoulder-length red hair and brownish-red eyes. She is a bit taller than the average Bosmer, who are typically quite short.\r\nFort Dawnguard is a large fort southeast of Riften which serves as the Dawnguard's base of operations. The fort is home to an order of vampire hunters who guard Skyrim from vampires (especially those of the Volkihar clan). The fort is hidden deep within the Velothi Mountains at the southeastern tip of The Rift (and of Skyrim), and can only be reached via Dayspring Canyon.\r\nA Redguard man named Isran is the leader of the Dawnguard. Isran is stoic, uncompromising, and is always deadly serious. Isran probably hates vampires more than anyone else does, and many have deemed his methods to be extreme.\r\nBeleval and Ingjard (a Nord woman) are two of the newest members of the Dawnguard. Sorine Jurard and Gunmar joined shortly before Beleval and Ingjard joined. Sorine is a Breton woman who specializes who in the art of crafting crossbows and crossbow bolts, heavily influenced by the methods of the ancient Dwemer. Gunmar is a Nord man who serves as the Dawnguard's main blacksmith, and who also trains and armors trolls for use in fighting vampires. The player joined shortly before Sorine and Gunmar joined, and helped convince them to join.\r\nBeleval is willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. She will also be open to being hired as the steward of one of the player's homesteaded properties, if asked.\r\nBeleval's default attire is a brown set of Dawnguard heavy armor. She only puts on her helmet if battle is imminent. When it comes to fighting, her default melee weapon is a Dawnguard war axe, and her default ranged weapon is a crossbow supplemented with a supply of steel bolts. During combat, she will switch between the war axe and the crossbow, depending on the situation. If she runs out of crossbow bolts, she may switch to her hunting bow and her supply of iron arrows. She will be willing to use other melee weapons instead of her Dawnguard war axe if she finds or is given a weapon of higher quality.\r\nBeleval spends a fair amount of time practicing with her crossbow on dummy targets within Fort Dawnguard, often alongside Ingjard.\r\nQuotes:\r\nUpon first meeting the player, if the player is not an elf: \"Seems that I'm the only of my kind here. Suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Still, it's my duty to help protect Skyrim as much as any Nord's, don't you think?\"\r\nUpon first meeting the player, if the player is an elf: \"Not a lot of our kind here, I see. Suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Still, those of us here have as much of an obligation to protect Skyrim as any other, wouldn't you agree?\"\r\nIf asked why she joined the Dawnguard: \"Isran is the only one trying to do something about these vampires. I don't much like him, but I can't allow the people of Skyrim to be preyed upon by those monsters.\"",
