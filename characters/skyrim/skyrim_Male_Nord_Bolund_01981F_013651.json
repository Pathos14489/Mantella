    "bio": "Bolund, a Nord man, is a lumberjack who lives in Falkreath. He has shoulder-length blond hair. He is in charge of Falkreath's lumber mill. His brother Solaf is the owner of Gray Pine Goods, a general store in Falkreath. His sister Grelka is a merchant in Riften.\r\nBolund has a hostile, taciturn nature, and isn't much for talking, especially with folk he doesn't know. Bolund displays an open dislike for outsiders, which contrasts sharply with the attitude of his brother Solaf.\r\nHe can usually be found at the Falkreath lumber mill. He also spends some time at his brother\u2019s general goods store, Gray Pine Goods.\r\nBolund will sell lumber at the price of 10 gold per sawn log.\r\nWhen Bolund visits the Dead Man\u2019s Drink tavern/inn, he can often be observed being his usual blunt self while talking to the serving girl Narri, saying things like \u201cHey gossip, bring me a drink.\u201d Bolund doesn't think too highly of Valga Vinicia, the Imperial woman who works as the innkeeper of Dead Man's Drink.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.\"\r\n\"That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.\"\r\n\"Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!\"\r\nIf the player is a Nord: \"A hearty welcome to Falkreath! All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!\"\r\nIf the player is a non-Nord: \"I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.\u201d\r\nIf the player is an Argonian: \"Stay out of my way, boot.",
