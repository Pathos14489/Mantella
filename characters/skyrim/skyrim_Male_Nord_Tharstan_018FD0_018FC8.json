    "bio": "Tharstan, an elderly man, is a historian who can be found in the Skaal village, studying the Skaal people. This village is located near the northeastern tip of the island of Solstheim.\r\nTharstan is one of the people recently mind-controlled by Miraak and mentally forced to build a strange structure around the Wind Stone near the Skaal village. Luckily, the player (who is the Dragonborn) used their dragon shout to cleanse the Wind Stone of Miraak's influence, thus freeing Tharstan and the other mentally enslaved villagers.\r\nTharstan will eventually ask the Dragonborn to aid him in the expedition of an ancient Nordic ruin called Vahlok's Tomb.\r\nTharstan is in a close but somewhat discrete romantic relationship with Fanari Strong-Voice, a younger woman who is the leader of the Skaal village.",
