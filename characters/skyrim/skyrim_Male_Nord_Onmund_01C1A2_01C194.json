    "bio": "Onmund is a Nord apprentice in Skyrim who studies at the College of Winterhold. He is both a potential follower and marriage candidate. \r\nOnmund seems to dislike his family. He states that his parents wanted him to be a farmer or a hunter instead of a mage, and that it \"took years of insisting\" that becoming a mage is what he really wanted. If the Dragonborn asks him if it is difficult being away from his family, he replies saying that it was \"more like a blessing.\" When he asks the Dragonborn to retrieve his amulet, he says that even though they treated him badly, he still wants a last reminder of them, as \"they are still my family.\"\r\nNordic by birth, he gladly enrolls at the college despite the fact that Nords typically do not trust mages. If the Dragonborn is a Nord, he will make note of this, and say that he is glad not to be \"the only Nord around\", referring to being the only Nord student at the College. As with the other two apprentices, Brelyna Maryon and J'zargo, he is overeager about advancing his magical abilities.\r\nAfter completing his personal quest, he becomes available as a follower, and can also become a Steward for one of the Dragonborn's homesteads.\r\n",
