    "bio": "Aval Atheron is a Dunmer pawnbroker and meat vendor in Windhelm who lives at the Atheron Residence in the Grey Quarter district of Windhelm, and operates a stall at the marketplace in the Stone Quarter district of Windhelm. Aval lives with his two siblings. His brother Faryl works for a local Nord farmer, and his sister Suvaris works for Torbjorn Shatter-Shield at the Clan Shatter-Shield Office.\r\nAval wears a set of merchant clothes, a pair of boots, and a hat. He has a short mustache.\r\nAval is ashamed of his siblings for working for Nords, presumably because of the Nords\u2019 discrimination against the Dunmer people. However, he has a good attitude towards a tolerant Nord man named Brunwulf Free-Winter, and will offer Brunwulf a discount on his merchandise.\r\nAval hints at dealing in stolen goods, warning the player that if they are the type of person who worries about where things come from, they may want to not do business with him.\r\nAfter his work day at the marketplace ends in the evening, he will usually go to the New Gnisis Cornerclub to drink.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet.\"\r\n\"I've a little of everything for sale, come and see for yourself!\"\r\n\"I get my goods wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on.\"\r\n\"I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme.\"\r\n\"Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.\"\r\n\"Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you! If you see anything you like, just let me know and I'll glad offer you a discount. So few Nords have ever offered to help us, so a discount is the least I can do.\"\r\nIf the Empire has taken control of Windhelm and Brunwulf Free-Winter has become the Jarl of Windhelm: \u201cThe Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time. Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement. Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here. For the first time in a long while, I truly believe that there are brighter days ahead.\"",
