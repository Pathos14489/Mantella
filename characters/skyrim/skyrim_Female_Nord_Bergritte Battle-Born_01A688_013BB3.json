Alfhild is Bergritte's daughter. Alfhild is married to Idolaf. Lars is Idolaf and Alfhild\u2019s son, and Bergritte\u2019s grandson. \r\nAs family elder, Bergritte lives a relatively anonymous existence in Whiterun. Her daughter Alfhild reads to her sometimes during the evening. \r\nBergritte\u2019s clan is currently in a heated feud with the Gray-Mane clan, another prominent family in Whiterun.\r\nQuote:\r\n\"There's a rift here in Skyrim, and can't neither magic nor the passin' of time make it right.\"\r\n\"Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day.\"\r\n\"Can you believe those pathetic Gray-Manes still show their faces in public?\"\r\n\"There was love between our families. For generations. Now, there is only enmity.\"\r\nIf the Stormcloaks have taken control of Whiterun: \"It's a miracle these Stormcloaks haven't robbed us blind yet. I'm sure it's only a matter of time.\"",
