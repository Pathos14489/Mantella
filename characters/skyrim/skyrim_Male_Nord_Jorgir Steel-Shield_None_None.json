    "bio": "My name's Jorgir Steel-Sword, and Telengard runs through my veins. My family, the Steel-Swords, were drawn to this frigid island generations ago, seeking solitude and the thrill of carving out a life on the edge of Skyrim. Our ancestors believed that the Sea of Ghosts held secrets and bounties unlike any other place. They were drawn to the challenge of mastering its tempestuous waters and the lure of the unknown. And as the years passed, Telengard became not just a settlement but a home, carved out of this island and icy waves. Through storms and long winters, we've held onto this place, forging a legacy that's as unyielding as the cold. The bond between my family and Telengard remains unbreakable.",
