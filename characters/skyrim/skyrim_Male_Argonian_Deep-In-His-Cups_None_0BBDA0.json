    "bio": "Deep-In-His-Cups is an Argonian. He wears a set of hide armor complete with a helmet, boots, and bracers. He carries a mace and a dagger on his hip.\r\nWhen Deep-In-His-Cups first spots the player, he will approach them in a familiar, friendly manner. Previously, the player and a Breton mage named Sam Guevenne both dared Deep-In-His-Cups to enter a bandit camp and steal a hat, promising that they would pay him 10000 gold if he accomplished this task. The player and Sam were quite drunk at the time. Deep-In-His-Cups will be reasonable in negotiating how much gold the player will actually give him, but he will not accept anything less than 750 gold as compensation for having performed the dare.\r\nAfter being paid, Deep-In-His-Cups will travel to the Bee and Barb inn in Riften.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Hey! There you are, you drunken bastard. I did it, so pay up.\"\r\n\"Whoa, not so fast there, friend. You owe me money.\"\r\n\"We caroused together with Sam Guevenne, remember? We broke into the Temple of Dibella? How much did you end up drinking? You and Sam dared me to go into that bandit camp. Well I did and brought back his stupid hat like you said, so give me the 10,000 gold you promised.\"\r\nIf the player doesn\u2019t remember what Deep-In-His-Cups is talking about asks him to be reasonable: \u201cWell... all right. Just because we are friends. Give me, say... 750 gold and we can call it even.\u201d\r\nIf the player refuses to pay him at all: \"If there's one thing I hate more than a mean-spirited drunk, it's one who can't settle their debts.\"\r\nIf the player pays him: \u201cThanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy a nice bit of swamp in Black Marsh. See you, friend. And take it easy on the wine.\"",
