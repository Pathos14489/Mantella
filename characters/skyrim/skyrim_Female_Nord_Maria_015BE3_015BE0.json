    "bio": "Maria works as a barmaid at Honningbrew Meadery, near the city of Whiterun. Multiple rivers, stone bridges, and farms surround the area around the meadery.\r\nA midde-aged man named Sabjorn is the founder and owner the Honningbrew Meadery. Honningbrew is a newly established competitor to the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften. Honningbrew Meadery is small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality. The smaller front section of the meadery serves as a tavern that serves mead to customers directly, while the larger back section is where the mead is actually produced and stored. In addition to Honningbrew mead, the tavern also offers customers food and other drinks.\r\nSabjorn\u2019s senior assistant is an Imperial man named Mallus, and his junior assistant is a young man named Eimar. Mallus complains a lot, while Eimar is a hard and cheerful worker. Maria has a barmaid coworker named Heidi. A woman named Lindyth often performs as a bard within the tavern area, singing or playing her flute.\r\nMaria is a Nord woman with green eyes and long golden blonde hair. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Maria walks around the tavern area of the meadery, serving customers.",
