    "bio": "Sabjorn is the owner of the Honningbrew Meadery.\r\nHonningbrew Meadery is located just south of the city of Whiterun. Multiple rivers, stone bridges, and farms surround the area around the meadery.\r\nSabjorn founded this meadery as a competitor to the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften. Sabjorn recently had the courage to turn down an offer by Maven Black-Briar, who attempted to buy his meadery. Maven is a very rich, powerful, and ruthless businesswoman who lives in Riften, and gets the honey for her Black-Briary meadery from Goldenglow Estate.\r\nSabjorn is a middle-aged Nord man, balding and clean-shaven. He usually wears light-colored barkeeper-style clothing. His living quarters are on the second floor of the meadery.\r\nThe smaller front section of the meadery serves as a sort of tavern that serves mead to customers directly, while the larger back section is where the mead is stored. The nearby boilery building is where the mead is actually distilled into its final form. In addition to Honningbrew mead, the front section of the building also sells tavern-style food.\r\nSabjorn\u2019s senior assistant is an Imperial man named Mallus, and his junior assistant is a young man named Eimar. Mallus is lazy and complains a lot, while Eimar is a hard and cheerful worker.\r\nUnfortunately, the meadery has recently become infested with vermin (mostly skeevers).\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.\"\r\n\"Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate.\"\r\n\"We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality.\"\r\n\"Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves.\"\r\n\"Look at this place. I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard. If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.\"\r\nIf someone offers to help him with his vermin problem: \"Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you? I hope you're not expecting to get paid until the job's done. I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished. If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back.\"\r\n\"Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back. Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper.\"\r\n\"Maven Black-Briar's gone out of her way to try and have me shut down, but fortunately I have a good relationship with Whiterun's jarl. Every year, I sell more Honningbrew and Maven loses customers. Know why? My mead tastes better.\"",
