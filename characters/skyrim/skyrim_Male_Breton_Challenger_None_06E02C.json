    "bio": "Challenger is a Breton man who has come to challenge the player to a magical duel. The player is adept in at least one of the five schools of magic.\r\nThe Challenger wants his upcoming duel with the player to conform to all of their standards. None of the player's friends should assist the player in their duel. Weapons should also not be used, though the Challenger has a weapon ready for use just in case the player decides to cheat and use a weapon. If the Dragonborn does draw his weapon, the Challenger will draw his own weapon. Bound weapons may not be technically physical weapons, but they still violate the spirit of a magical duel.\r\nIf the player refuses the Challenger's request for a duel, the Challenger will become offended and attack the player.",
