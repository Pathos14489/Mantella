    "bio": "Qa\u2019Dojo, a Khajiit man, is a monk who believes the Aedra and Daedra each hold a place in the pantheon of Divines. His belief system is based on the idea of balance, and how the forces of chaos and order must be level in order for the world to achieve a state of true harmony. Many of his stories are inspired by or based on famous zen parables, while others are original creations that only vaguely resemble their zen origins.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
