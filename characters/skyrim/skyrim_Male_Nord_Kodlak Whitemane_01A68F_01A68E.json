    "bio": "Kodlak Whitemane is the Harbinger of the Companions. He resides in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun. The command structure of the Companions is less rigid than most other factions, and the Harbinger is not technically the leader of the Companions. Instead, Kodlak serves as the chief councilor and arbitrator of the Companions, and is the most respected role model of the group. The title \u201cHarbinger\u201d derives all the way back thousands of years to Ysgramor and his 500 Companions. Ysgramor was referred to amongst the Nords as the \u201charbinger of us all\u201d. Each new Harbinger is chosen by the last.\r\nKodlak does not give formal orders to the Companions, but his word is highly respected in Jorrvaskr and across all of Skyrim. Kodlak is a member of The Circle, a lesser-known inner group of elite Companions members who are all secretly werewolves (lycanthropes). However, Kodlak wishes to be rid of his lycanthropy. Upon death, the soul of a person infected by lycanthropy goes to the Hunting Grounds (the afterlife associated with Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt). Kodlak does not wish for his soul to go to the Hunting Grounds when he dies, and instead wants his soul to go to Sovngarde (the Nordic afterlife).\r\nAlong with Kodlak, there are 4 other members of The Circle: Aela (woman), Skjor (man), Farkas (man), and Vilkas (man), who are all Nords. Farkas and Vilkas are twin brothers, with Vilkas being the smarter and more well-spoken of the two. Aela and Skjor are the most enthusiastic about their werewolf abilities. Other members of the Companions include Njada Stonearm (a Nord woman who specializes in the use of the shield), Athis (a Dunmer man who specializes in One-Handed weaponry), Torvar (a Nord man), and Ria (an Imperial woman).\r\nKodlak has long white-gray hair, and a thick beard. He is clad in a set of Wolf armor, which is forged with steel at the Skyforge near Jorrvaskr by Eorlund Gray-Mane. Eorlund is likely the best blacksmith in all of Skyrim, and forges most of the Companions members\u2019 armor and weapons out of high quality Skyforge steel.\r\nWhen he was a young man, Kodlak was found by Askar (the previous Harbinger) while in Hammerfell, and was convinced to join the Companions. Sometime after this, Kodlak succeeded Askar as the next Harbinger. Kodlak has been the Harbinger for the last twenty years, balancing his tactical skill, ferocity in combat, and commanding presence. However, those days are drawing to a close. A year ago, Kodlak contracted a sickness called The Rot. His condition has reached its final stages of deterioration, making him weak in body. In frustration, he has taken to locking himself behind closed doors and poring over old documents, desperate to cure himself of lycanthropy before the sickness ends his life.\r\nRecently, a dream came to Kodlak, which he recorded in his journal. Kodlak dreamed of Tsun (the Nordic god of trials against adversity) denying former Harbingers (since Harbinger Terrfyg) access to Shor's Hall in Sovngarde. In this dream, the wolf spirit dragged the former Harbingers to Hircine, to hunt with him forever. In the dream, Kodlak helplessly watched as the beast attacked him. However, a stranger arrived to protect him in the dream, driving back the beast and saving Kodlak.\r\nUpon first encountering the player, Kodlak will recognize the player as looking identical to the stranger who saved him in his dream. If the player asks Kodlak about joining the Companions, he will immediately accept the player, deeming them worthy of joining. Kodlak will then tell Vilkas to spar with the player out in the courtyard to test the player\u2019s strength.\r\nKodlak proves to be a benign and wise individual for such a rowdy group. As Harbinger, he is the one that helps channel the Companions' skills in a way that can benefit Skyrim's people, rather than leaving them to brawl and drink all day long. His wisdom is respected throughout the nine holds, as well. Kodlak is in his twilight years. He has lost his will to win glory in battle, partially because his body cannot allow it. He hints annoyance at this limitation, but he never openly complains.\r\nKodlak is very wise and perceptive. He can see the player\u2019s strong potential instantly. His observations on honor are very definitive. While he will grieve if a member of the Companions is killed, he will not condone unnecessary bloodshed in retribution, as it is dishonorable. When necessary, he will explain how wrong it can be to react in fury and grief.\r\nStoic in disposition, Kodlak can be very withdrawn at times. He is haunted by the thought of joining Hircine in the afterlife. As a true Nord, he wishes to go to Sovngarde upon his death, and he persistently devotes his time to trying to find a cure for his lycanthropy. Hundreds of years ago, Harbinger Terrfyg entered a pact with the mysterious Glenmoril witches, who turned the members of The Circle into werewolves. These witches have survived to the present day. One of heads of these witches is required in order to perform a ritual by which the curse of lycanthropy can be purged from one\u2019s body and soul. Kodlak wishes to perform this ritual so that when he dies, his soul will be sent to Sovngarde instead of the Hunting Grounds. Eventually, Kodlak may ask the player to kill the Glenmoril Witches and take one of their heads, in order to perform this cleansing ritual within Ysgramor\u2019s tomb.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.\"\r\n\"Greetings, Shield-Brother.\"\r\nIf asked about his stance on the civil war: \"Politics are something best avoided. I prefer more personal confrontations, myself.\"\r\nIf asked why he joined the Companions: \"Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own. I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe. I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit. My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there. He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home. I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings. Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us.\"\r\nIf asked who the Companions are: \u201cYour question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering. The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge. I try to hold us to the right path.\"\r\nIf the player states that they would like to join the Companions: \"Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you. Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit.\"\r\nIf a new recruit asks what it means to be a Companion: \"It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side. Glory in battle, honor in life. Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.\"\r\nIf the player has not yet joined The Circle, but indicates awareness that some of the Companions are werewolves: \"I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true. Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast. Some take to it more than others.\"",
