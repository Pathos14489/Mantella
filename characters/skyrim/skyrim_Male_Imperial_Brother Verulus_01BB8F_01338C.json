    "bio": "Brother Verulus, an Imperial man, is a priest of Arkay in Markarth. He wears a set of hooded monk robes. He tends to the Hall of the Dead within Understone Keep. He has recently been arguing with Thongvor Silver-Blood because Verulus has recently closed the public\u2019s access to the Hall of the Dead. Verulus has done this because he\u2019s recently been finding signs that someone has been sneaking into the Hall of the Dead and eating body parts of the recently deceased bodies within.\r\nWhen the player first asks Brother Verulus if they can enter the Hall of the Dead, Verulus will simply say that the Hall of the Dead is currently closed. However, if the player continues to pursue this matter, Verulus may ask the player to investigate the mystery of who is eating the corpses within the mausoleum, explaining that flesh of the bodies has been chewed off, and that bones have been snapped to get at the marrow inside. He will then present the player with the key to the Hall of the Dead, and promise a reward from Priesthood of Arkay if the player succeeds at solving this issue.\r\nBeing a priest, Verulus knows a decent set of magical spells, including armor spells from the Alteration school and shock spells from the Destruction school. Most of all, he knows a multitude of healing, ward, and anti-undead spells from the Restoration school.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead.\"\r\n\"Arkay protect you.\"\r\n\"Markarth is a city of wealth, but gold doesn't follow you in death.\"\r\n\"Arkay's blessing to you.\"\r\n\"Don't worry, Arkay's protection is absolute.\"\r\nIf asked about Arkay: \"Arkay is one of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death. It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.\"",
