    "bio": "Vingalmo, an Altmer man, is a vampire\u00a0and member of\u00a0the Volkihar Clan. He is\u00a0one of Lord Harkon's primary advisors. He and fellow senior vampire Orthjolf are embroiled in a feud over the throne, and can be often heard making cutting remarks towards one another.\r\nVingalmo was first met when the player enters Castle Volkihar with Serana. He confronted the player for \"trespassing,\" but upon seeing Serana he excitedly announced to the rest of the court that she has returned. The second time he is encountered, he and Orthjolf will be arguing in the dining room. Once their dialogue is complete, he will warn the player not to trust Orthjolf, and Orthjolf says much the same about Vingalmo.\r\nHe is also mentioned in the Night Of Tears, which says he wrote a book about ancient Saarthal called \"Treatise on the Altmer Antecedent\".\r\nUpon starting the quest, Vingalmo is surprised to hear Harkon is sending the Dragonborn to fill the chalice and reacts with suspicion.\r\nOnce the player fills the chalice from the bloodspring, Stalf and Salonia Caelia spring an ambush. It is revealed that Vingalmo sent Salonia Caelia in pursuit to kill the player and retrieve the chalice. Vingalmo hoped that this would give him more power and would bring him one step closer to claiming Harkon's throne.\r\nVingalmo has found a new candidate, ripe for Harkon's Gift. He sends the player to welcome the person into the family.\r\nVingalmo mentions that he knows the player has a spouse, and asks that they be turned into a vampire.\r\n",
