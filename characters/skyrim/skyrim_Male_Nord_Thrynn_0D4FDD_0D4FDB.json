    "bio": "Thrynn is a Nord\u00a0thief\u00a0and a member of the Thieves Guild in Riften.\r\nBefore joining the Guild, Thrynn spent three years working with the same bandit clan that would raid villages, rob farms, and rob caravans. However, after attacking a caravan of farmers and rounding up the women and children, Garthek, the clan leader, ordered them to be killed. Thrynn refused, and Garthek ordered Thrynn to be killed as well. Those who were faithful to Thrynn sided with him immediately. The clan then tore itself apart, and Thrynn personally put Garthek's head on a pike. Those that survived went their separate ways.\r\nThrynn:\u00a0\"Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?\" Thrynn:\u00a0\"If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir.\"",
