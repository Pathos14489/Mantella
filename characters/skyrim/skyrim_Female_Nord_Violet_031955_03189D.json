An older Redguard woman named Saadia and a younger Redguard woman named Tamda also work as barmaids there. A woman named Lyne also works as a barmaid there, and additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn. \r\nViolet is a tall Nord woman with long flowing brown hair and pretty blue eyes. She typically wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Violet walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
