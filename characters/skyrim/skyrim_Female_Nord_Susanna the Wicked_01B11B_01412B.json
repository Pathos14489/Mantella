    "bio": "Susanna lives in Windhelm. She works as a barmaid at Candlehearth Hall, a popular inn/tavern near the main gate of the city. She is employed by Elda Early-Dawn, the middle-aged woman who runs Candlehearth.\r\nSusanna is a beautiful buxom Nord woman with blue eyes and long blonde hair. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit.\r\nCandlehearth Hall is a large wooden two-story building. Candlehearth's front ground floor area functions as a taproom, where Elda often stands behind her counter, at times chatting with the regulars. The rear half of the ground floor contains the inn's private rooms and the kitchen, where an elderly man named Nils serves as the cook. The second floor is spacious and consists of one huge room with several tables where the regulars can enjoy their drinks and the performances from the bard, a Dark Elf woman named Luaffyn. A central fireplace keeps the second floor warm. A famous author, an Imperial man named Adonato Leotelli, has been staying at Candlehearth as of late. Adonato can usually be found sitting at a table on the second floor, focused on his writing. Other notable patrons include a mercenary named Stenvar, a wealthy businessman and clan patriarch Torbjorn Shatter-Shield, a retired sailor named Captain Lonely-Gale, and an older wealthy Imperial woman named Viola Giordano.\r\nSusanna sympathizes with the plight of the Dark Elves and Argonians in Windhelm, who face racial discrimination in the city. The Dark Elves are relegated to living in the slums of the Gray Quarter of the city. The Argonians are not allowed to enter the main city at all, restricted to Windhelm's docks and nearby buildings.\r\nAn elusive man (dubbed \"The Butcher\") has recently been murdering young women in Windhelm and carving up their bodies. Susanna tries to be careful when walking the streets alone.\r\nSusanna is sometimes called \"Susanna the Wicked\". This humorous title \"the Wicked\" is a stark contrast to Susanna's genuinely kind personality, and is intended to be ironic.\r\nAccording to Elda, Susanna \"plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips.\" Susanna indeed often behaves quite flirtatiously, towards both men and women. She speaks in a seductive sultry voice.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter.\"\r\n\"Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?\"\r\n\"How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?\"",
