    "bio": "I'm Guardsman Fringar. Hmph, Dragonborn, I remember the day you defeated your first dragon well. When that blasted thing attacked the Whiterun Watch Tower, it was chaos like you wouldn't believe. Flames, screams, the whole city on edge. I didn't know you from any other traveler back then. Just another stranger stepping up to the plate when trouble hit. We were doing our damnedest to keep it at bay. We formed a line, shields up, arrows flying, but it was clear that dragon was something else entirely. A nightmare made flesh. And then there you were, taking that thing right out of the sky! I did my part by loosing arrows at that scaled beast. To be honest, I didn't care who you were at the time, Dragonborn or not. I was just glad someone had the guts to stand up and fight. After that, I like to unwind by carving intricate wooden figurines. It's much more peaceful than dragonslaying. It's a skill I picked up from my father, and it helps pass the time when I'm not patrolling these walls. Maybe one day I'll carve a dragon to commemorate the day we took that beast down together. But for now, just know that even if I didn't recognize your destiny that day, I'm grateful you were there to lend a hand when Whiterun needed it most.",
