If you ask him about the Forsworn he will say not to get involved in that nonsense and he says the only thing he wants to do is work.\r\nFound in The Warrens of Markarth or at work at the citys smelter. During the evenings he spends a portion of his wages at the Silver-Blood Inn with his friend and co-worker Omluag.\r\nHe barely speaks to the Dragonborn, and most of the time, when he does its telling them he has to get back to work.",
