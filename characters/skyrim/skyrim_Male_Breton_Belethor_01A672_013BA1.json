    "bio": "Belethor is a Breton man who owns the Belethor's General Goods store in Whiterun. As a general merchant, he buys and sells almost everything. His store is located next to the Arcadia\u2019s Cauldron alchemy shop, and is on the opposite side of the market square from the Bannered Mare inn.\r\nBelethor will occasionally jokingly remark that he would sell his sister for gold, if he had one, and that he would be willing to buy any customers' relatives, should they have any. His reputation within Whiterun is far from sparkling, as the Whiterun Guards refer to him as a \"sleazy little man.\" Unlike most Bretons, he does not have a serious personality. He is constantly making puns and is very sarcastic, especially when he's asked why he moved to Skyrim, or whether or not the Skyrim Civil War has been hard on the city's merchants.\r\nWhen conversed with, he may speak of the current trading situation in the Whiterun region. Because of the dragon attacks in Helgen, there is a lack of goods and products around the city, which results in higher prices. Belethor has employed the help of a young Nord man named Sigurd to do menial tasks around the shop for him. Belethor and Sigurd live in separate rooms on the second floor of the store building.\r\nIf the player invests in Belethor\u2019s business, he will consider the player to be his friend.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.\"\r\n\"I'd even buy one of your relatives, if you're looking to sell! Ha ha ha... That's a little joke.\"\r\n\"I know what you're thinking: 'This Belethor, how could he part with such magnificent treasures?'\"\r\n\"I can tell you're a discriminating customer. Maybe a wealthy one too?\"\r\n\"Imperials, Stormcloaks... I don't care who's in charge around here. I just want to make money!\"\r\n\"Everything's for sale, my friend! You need visit no other shops today!\"\r\n\"I assure you, I'm prepared to make any deal.\"\r\n\"Please, do look around. I'm sure I have something you'll want.\"\r\n\"Remember, I'll give you the best deals, or die trying.\"",
