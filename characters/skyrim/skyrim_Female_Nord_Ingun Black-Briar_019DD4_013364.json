    "bio": "Ingun Black-Briar lives in Riften. She is a young Nord woman with amber eyes and dark hair, resembling her mother in appearance but not in personality. Like the rest of her family, she usually wears expensive fine clothing. Ingun is the daughter of Maven Black-Briar, the matriach of the Black-Briar family. The Black-Briars are undeniably the most affluent and influential family in Riften. Ingun has two older brothers named Hemming and Sibbi.\r\nIngun is fascinated by alchemy and is quite talented at it. She studies alchemy at an alchemy shop called Elgrim's Elixirs in Riften's lower levels, near the canal that runs through the city. At this shop, she serves as an apprentice to an elderly man named Elgrim. Elgrim's wife Hafjorg helps him run the shop. While Elgrim recognizes and appreciates Ingun's natural talent with alchemy, Ingun sometimes feels like he is too reluctant to entrust her with more advanced formulas.\r\nIngun been performing morbid but fascinating experiments on animals since she was a child. She spends nearly every day in the shop training in alchemy, and usually returns to straight home to her family's manor in the evening. She usually eats her meals alongside her family in their dining room. Her bedroom is in the manor's basement, which also contains an alchemy lab and ingredients.\r\nIngun generally dislikes her family. Her mother sometimes threatens to withhold money from her if she doesn't start taking interest in the family's business affairs. Ingun is more eloquent and polite than her brothers. Her brother Sibbi is currently a prisoner in the Riften jail under Mistveil Keep (the jarl's palace in the city). Sibbi is serving an eight month sentence for stabbing and killing Wulfur (the brother of his former fiance Svidi), though Sibbi claims this was done in self-defense.\r\nUnfortunately, Ingun's recent experimental mistakes have wasted some of Elgrim's rare alchemy ingredients (in particular, nirnroot, nightshade, and deathbell), and she may request assistance in replacing these ingredients. Ingun will pay 750\u00a0gold for a batch of these three ingredients, and will also provide (as a supplementary reward) a key to her supply chest in the back of the Elgrim's Elixirs shop, in which Ingun sometimes stores some of her crafted potions.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Hm? Sorry, just thinking about my experiments.\"\r\n\"My mind is on my experiments today. What did you need?\"\r\nIf asked what fascinates her about alchemy: \"It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind. We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive. Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are. You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.\"\r\nIf asked about her family: \"Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes. I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles. If only my mother would let me, I would make her proud.\"\r\nIf asked if she's an alchemist: \"I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls. Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes. My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.\"\r\nIf asked what ingredients she needs: \"To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot. Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?\"\r\nIf asked where to find the rare ingredients: \"Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower. Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.\"\r\nIf her requested rare ingredients are delivered to her: \"Perfect. This is just what I needed. These are excellent samples. Thank you. Here's some coin for all the trouble. Master Elgrim will be pleased that I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients. I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs. Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.\"",
