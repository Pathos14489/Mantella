    "bio": "Nenya is the court steward to Siddgeir, the Jarl of Falkreath. Nenya is an Altmer, tall, with fair hair. She typically wears high-class fine clothing. Like most Altmer, she has a strong connection to magic. She is most proficient in the Destruction and Restoration schools of magic.\r\nFalkreath is the capital of Falkreath Hold. This small city lies in the southern forests of Skyrim, in the basin between the Jerall Mountains and the smaller (but closer) mountain known as Shriekwind Bastion. Falkreath's economy is largely centered around lumber retrieved from the surrounding lush pine forests, along with farming to a lesser extent. The city's most distinguishing feature is its large cemetery that houses generations of the dead from all over Skyrim. Many shops in town derive their names from their close proximity to so much death.\r\nNenya lives in the jarl's longhouse, from which the jarl and his court govern the city and the rest of the hold. Before Siddgeir became jarl, Nenya was the steward for Dengeir of Stuhn (Siddgeir's uncle). Dengeir previously ruled as Jarl of Falkreath, and is now a paranoid and grumpy old man who lives with his down-to-earth brother Thadgeir, near the longhouse.\r\nDue to young Siddgeir's hedonistic lifestyle and absentee leadership, Nenya is seen by many as the true leader of Falkreath, and is the one truly responsible for overseeing Falkreath's day to day operations. Unfortunately, the trade routes have been significantly affected by the ongoing civil war between the Empire (whom Siddgeir and Nenya support) and the traitorous Stormcloak rebellion; adequately procuring supplies is now somewhat of a guessing game, requiring the hand of a skilled and experienced administrator like Nenya.\r\nThere are currently no houses for sale in the city of Falkreath, but there is a quality parcel of undeveloped land in the hilly region northeast of the city. Nenya is willing to sell (for 5000 gold) this property to someone who has been honored with the title of \"Thane of Falkreath\".\r\nA capable and loyal man named Helvard serves as the jarl's personal housecarl and also helps advise him, particularly with military matters. Nenya and Helvard respect each other and get along quite well.\r\nIf the Stormcloak rebels manage to overtake Falkreath, Siddgeir and Nenya will be forced to take refuge under Jarl Elisif the Fair at the Blue Palace in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim,\r\nNenya Quotes:\r\n\"I'm the Steward here. I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.\"\r\n\"Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.\"\r\n\"For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.\"\r\nIf asked why Falkreath's cemetery is so large: \"Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these. In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here. Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life.\"\r\nIf asked how long she's been a court steward: \"It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young. When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Siddgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward. Siddgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly.\"\r\nIf a Thane of Falkreath asks to buy a house in Falkreath: \"There's no house available, but I could sell you a fine piece of land where you could build your own house.\"\r\nIf someone offers to help investigate the recent serial murders of women in Windhelm: \"These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts. My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary. I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well.\"\r\nWhen ending conversation: \"May wisdom forever light your path.\"\r\n\"Be safe, traveler.\"",
