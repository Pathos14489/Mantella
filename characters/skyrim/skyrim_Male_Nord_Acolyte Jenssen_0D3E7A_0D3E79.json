    "bio": "Acolyte Jenssen is an assistant priest who works and lives at the Temple of Kynareth in the Wind District of Whiterun. He is a Nord man with shoulder-length black hair and a beard. He typically wears monk robes. He is usually found in or around the temple. Sick and injured people often come to the temple for healing. Jenssen can usually be found either standing over the beds of sick visitors and performing healing spells on them, or performing repairs and routine maintenance on the temple building. Jenssen is the apprentice of Danica Pure-Spring, a middle-aged woman who serves as the head priestess of Kynareth in Whiterun.\r\nKynareth is a goddess of the Nine Divines. She is the deity of the heavens, the winds, the elements, and the unseen spirits of the air. The patron of sailors and travelers, Kynareth is invoked for auspicious stars at birth and for good fortune in daily life. She is also associated with rain. The Throat of the World (the tallest peak in all of Tamriel, to the southeast of Whiterun) is considered to be Kynareth's sacred mountain. She is also cited to have gifted the Thu'um (also called The Voice) to the first Nord heroes. To the Nords in Skyrim, Kynareth has historically been known as \"Kyne\", and she is believed to be the wife of the Nordic god Shor. In modern times (the Fourth Era), as a result of the Empire\u2019s continuous cultural and religious influence in Skyrim, most Nords have come to refer to Kyne by her Imperial name - Kynareth. However, there are still some Nords who refer to her as Kyne.\r\nA prominent tree at the center of Whiterun\u2019s Wind District, known as the Gildergreen, is considered to be sacred to Kynareth. The Temple of Kynareth is located very close to this famous tree. Unfortunately the Gildergreen was recently struck by lightning, and Danica has not yet managed to acquire the resources necessary to heal it.\r\nAn example of Jenssen's dialogue when talking to sick and injured visitors to the temple: \"Patience. The body needs time to mend. More rest will do you good. Try to relax. You'll be well soon enough.\"",
