    "bio": "Grosta is a Nord who owns and operates the Heartwood Mill.\r\nShe lived there with her husband, Leifnarr, and son, Gralnach, until Leifnarr disappeared. She seems to think that her husband left to be with another woman and is very curt when referring to him, though she still wants to find out what has happened to him.\r\nShe is generally warm towards the Dragonborn, but ultimately comes off as hardened by the disappearance of her husband. She expresses little discernible emotion as she matter of factually states that the mill will go under in a few seasons without him.\r\nThe Dragonborn is sent to locate her missing husband, Leifnarr, who she says was headed towards Broken Helm Hollow. Exploring this hollow reveals Leifnarr's fate - he died honorably.",
