Desperate for money, he attempted to sell a family heirloom only to find Belethor was more interested in buying his junk. He then developed a business to charge adventurers to alleviate them of their junk and sell it to Belethor for an additional profit. Filled with vitriol for his former employer, the Redguard Nazeem, Eldar hopes of one day reaching the Cloud District. high elf and destruction mage who specializes in fire. She has spent many a day in Whiterun where she has made acquaintance with a number of people including Larkspur, Hulda, and Sinmir. A devout lover of wine with a playful sarcastic nature, she is ostensibly an ordinary drunk. However, she is also a member of the Radiant Dark. This is a secret she will not reveal unless pressed. She has an on-off relationship with Sinmir, who she seems to be growing bored of.",
