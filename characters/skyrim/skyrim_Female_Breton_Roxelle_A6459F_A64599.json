    "bio": "Roxelle is a young woman who works as a bard.\r\nRoxelle and her twin sister were raised among the Forsworn of the Reach. Roxelle eventually left her family out of disapproval of the barbaric methods of the Forsworn, who rebel against Nordic rule of the Reach by raiding caravans and murdering innocent people. Unfortunately, her twin sister is still firmly entrenched in the Forsworn raider lifestyle. Roxelle is willing to discuss her past and her sister, though she would prefer that information regarding her associaton with the Forsworn not be shared with others.\r\nRoxelle has been playing as a member of an all-female trio of bards at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in the Grey Quarter of Windhelm, along with a young Dunmer named Evelyna and an Argonian named Beeele. This cornerclub/tavern is run by a Dunmer man named Ambarys Rendar, and is mostly frequented by the Dunmer who live in the Grey Quarter of the city.\r\nIf Roxelle's friend Evelyna's application to the Bard's College in Solitude (the provincial capital of Skyrim) is accepted, Roxelle and Beeele will soon move to Solitude as well, and start frequently playing in the Winking Skeever tavern in Solitude.",
