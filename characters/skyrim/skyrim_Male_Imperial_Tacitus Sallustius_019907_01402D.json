    "bio": "Tacitus Sallustius is an Imperial found in Markarth and works for Ghorza gra-Bagol at the blacksmith's forge near Cidhna Mine.\r\nTacitus is an admitted failure at smithing and can only produce nails, and even those are of questionable quality, much to Ghorza's frustration. When running the forge, he is shown to be very unconfident with his abilities, which is possibly the reason why he can only produce nails, despite Ghorza's teaching.\r\nEven through his repeated failures, Tacitus seems to show a willingness to continue practicing his abilities.\r\nBecause of Tacitus' failures, the Dragonborn is tasked with a miscellaneous quest to obtain a copy of The Last Scabbard of Akrash.\r\nGhorza \"You strike the metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder!\" Tacitus \"I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just...flinch, and...uh...\" Ghorza \"If you can't pound the dust out of your iron, it'll break when it's finished. Hit. It. Harder!\"\r\nTacitus \"When will I learn to forge weapons and armor? Isn't that my job?\" Ghorza \"Your job is to do what I say. And I say you have many nails and fittings to make before you even touch a blade. Now get to work.\"\r\nTacitus \"Uh, a nail?\" Ghorza \"Is that what you call it? In the Legion we would have called it \"useless.\" Look how brittle the metal is!\" Tacitus \"I...I'm sorry. I just, well, the forge gets so hot and I thought...\" Ghorza \"You thought what? You skip a step? Not heat the metal all the way through? Useless! Now do it again.\"",
