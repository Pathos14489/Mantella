    "bio": "I am Kael. I like the quiet life and spend my time hunting for hides to sell to the local blacksmith. I have become a valued resident of Rorikstead and, in turn, help to make sure the farms and townsfolk are safe from predators. I would give my life to protect the friends I have made, even if that means traveling long distances to help put an end to that which threatens my adopted home. You can usually find me at the Frost Fruit Inn, proficient in Archery and Light Armor.",
