    "bio": "Umurn is an Orsimer ranger residing in the stronghold of Dushnikh Yal.\r\nUmurn is the son of Chief Burguk and Gharol, one of his wives. She was given the job of Forge-Wife, thus having to provide weapons and armor for the stronghold. She has adopted him as an apprentice, and they both work outside of the mine.\r\nAccording to dialogue, he hopes to one day forge a weapon suitable for a chief, perhaps himself. He has a full-blood sister named Lash gra-Dushnikh who has run away from the stronghold to the village of Karthwasten.\r\nShould the Dragonborn kill any of the women within Dushnikh Yal, Umurn will hire two thugs to retaliate. A contract can be looted from the thugs which explains that the Dragonborn killed his \"beloved.\" Umurn's thugs will appear even if he was previously killed.",
