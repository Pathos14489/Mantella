    "bio": "Faryl Atheron is a Dunmer farmer working at the Brandy-Mug Farm, just outside of Windhelm.\r\nHe lives in the Atheron Residence and can be found either there or somewhere within Windhelm. He is the brother of Aval Atheron and Suvaris Atheron.\r\nHe spends the majority of his time relaxing, sitting on the ledge in front of the New Gnisis Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter. He works for Bolfrida Brandy-Mug at her farm a few days out of the week, stating he has little choice as a Dunmer in Windhelm. He will further show his shame on the farm when he reveals that he is glad nobody from the city can see him out there.\r\nBolfrida: \"Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost...\" Faryl: \"I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles.\" Faryl: \"Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.\"",
