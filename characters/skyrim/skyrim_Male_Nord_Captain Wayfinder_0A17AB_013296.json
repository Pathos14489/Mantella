    "bio": "Captain Wayfinder, a young Nord man, is the captain of the Sea Squall. The Sea Squall is a merchant vessel, and is currently docked in Dawnstar. Wayfinder, can often be found conversing with his crew members, such as Guthrum (an older Nord man) and Ravam Verethi (a Dunmer man). Wayfinder's first name is Leif, but everyone calls him Captain Wayfinder. He has shoulder-length reddish-brown hair, and a small amount of facial hair.\r\nCaptain Wayfinder has been the captain of the Sea Squall for one year. Wayfinder inherited the ship from his mother, who passed away a year ago.\r\nWayfinder often feels frazzled and worried. Despite this, he also seems to be very sure of himself. He is a good-hearted person, and wants his crewmen to enjoy their work.\r\nWayfinder may ask the player to retrieve a special type of void salts, called Fine-Cut Void Salts. These Fine-Cut Void Salts are a valuable product that they were contracted to deliver. Before they were able to deliver the product, the crew of the Sea Squall got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in a cave. The location where the Fine-Cut Void Salts were lost will be one of the following caves (chosen at random): Forsaken Crypt, Brood Cavern, Duskglow Crevice, Broken Oar Grotto, or South Cold Rock Pass.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.\"\r\n\"I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too.\"\r\n\"I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men.\"\r\n\"Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong.\"\r\n\u201cMy mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house. I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems. Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. It\u2019s worth plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.\"\r\nIf asked how the Fine-Cut Void Salts got lost: \"Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave. If you're not afraid of a little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those salts.\"\r\nIf the Fine-Cut Void Salts are returned to him: \"This is the best news I've had since I set sail a year ago.\" ",
