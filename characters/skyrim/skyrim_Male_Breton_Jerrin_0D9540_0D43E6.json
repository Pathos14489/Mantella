    "bio": "Jerrin lives in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim. He is a wealthy Breton man with blond hair and a thick mustache. He often visits the Dragonborn Gallery, a recently opened museum near the Blue Palace. This museum displays all manner of rare, ancient, and powerful artifacts. The museum was founded and is curated by an Altmer named Auryen, who named the museum after the Dragonborn. The Dragonborn (the player) is the main provider of the museums artifacts, having personally secured most of them during the course of their adventures. Jerrin enjoys browsing the various displays and reading the accompanying information about the artifacts. He sometimes shows his appreciation for the museum by providing financial contributions.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Life's not so bad. I'm independently wealthy, though I don't wear it. So it's nice to just be able to wander about and take in the sights of Solitude.\"\r\n\"Ah, good day.\"\r\n\"Fine day, isn't it?\"\r\nWhen inside the Dragonborn Gallery: \"Not a bad place to pass some time. You have quite the collection here. I've been so impressed, in fact, that I've sent along a contribution or two to the curator. It's really amazing what you two are doing here, after all.\"\r\nWhen inside the Daedric Exhibit Hall: \"To think, all this evil in one place...\"",
