    "bio": "I'm Halion, younger brother to Armion, and I oppose the Thalmor, preaching the word of Talos. My actions have brought shame to my family and instability in my life. I constantly move from one town to another to avoid capture but frequently write to my brother reporting the abuses of the Thalmor against the citizens of Skyrim. I'm very much alone in Skyrim, chased by the Thalmor and despised by the Stormcloaks who can't tell one Altmer from another. I could certainly use a good friend right about now. I frequent the Winking Skeever, proficient in Destruction Magic and Heavy Armor.",
