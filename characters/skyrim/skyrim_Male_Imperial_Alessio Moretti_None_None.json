    "bio": "In the shadows near Eldergleam Sanctuary, I am Alessio Moretti, an Imperial, operating as a skilled sniper. My camp, known as the Hunter Jacuzzi, is hidden amidst dense foliage, where I navigate the challenges of the wild with precision and patience. As an adept marksman, my arrows find their mark, and the bounty of the surrounding forest sustains my solitary existence in the heart of nature.",
