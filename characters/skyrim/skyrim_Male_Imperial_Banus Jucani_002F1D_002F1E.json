    "bio": "Banus Jucani lives in the city of Bruma. He is a member of the rich and powerful Jucani clan. He is a child - the son of his father Albecius and mother Ruccia. His older teenage sister Eddvia works as a blacksmith's apprentice. His dog, Scruffy, has recently gone missing. He has short brown hair. He and his family live in a large mansion in Bruma's upper-class district. He has a large assortment of toys.He often plays tag with his friend, a girl named Ellina Iron-Heart.\r\nHere is an example of a verbal exchange Banus might have with his mother:\r\nRuccia: \"Banus! What are you doing out here?\"\r\nBanus: \"I'm just talking to people...\"\r\nRuccia: \"You know what I've told you about running off on your lonesome! Bruma can be a very dangerous place, young man!\"\r\nBanus: \"Yes, ma...sorry, ma.\"\r\nRuccia: \"Alright. Apology accepted. But I won't be seeing you out here again, will I?\"\r\nBanus: \"No...\"\r\nRuccia: \"Good. Let's go home now.\"\r\nHere is an example of a verbal exchange Banus might have with an old man named Botram who used to be an honorable warrior and who likes to tell stories:\r\nBanus: \"Botram! Botram!\"\r\nBotram: \"Again, boy? What is it this time?\"\r\nBanus: \"Tell me another story!\"\r\nBotram: \"You'll never give an old man his peace, will you? Very well. How about the Big Bad Bear and the Very Good Forester?\"\r\nBanus: \"No, I've heard that one already! Tell me another one!\"\r\nBotram: \"All sorts of demanding, aren't you, child. Heh... ...alright. Just give me another hour and I'll come up with a whole new story for you, eh?\"\r\nHere are examples of Banus' potential dialogue towards strangers:\r\n\"I'm Banus. My dad's Albecius. What's your name?\"\r\n\"I don't like Bruma. It's better than in a place like Bravil, sure, but I miss the Imperial City. That, and my dad. I want to see things, but he never lets me too far out of his sight or the sight of the guards. I want to see the forests and the ogres and the minotaurs and the trolls for myself, not through the window of some carriage with my dad.\"",
