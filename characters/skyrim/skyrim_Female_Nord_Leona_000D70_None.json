    "bio": "I am Leona, a true Nord warrior hailing from the frostbitten isle of Roscrea. The icy waters of the Sea of Ghosts were my playground, and the windswept cliffs my training ground. But I set sail for Skyrim with a singular purpose in mind: to cleanse this land of Thalmor tyranny. From a young age, I brandished the great sword, a weapon that spoke to my heart with its sheer power and unwavering resolve. Raised in the rugged traditions of my people, I learned the ways of the Nord warriors, and my resolve to free Skyrim from the Thalmor only grew stronger. I have ventured into the heart of enemy territory, infiltrating Thalmor outposts to gather information and sabotage their operations. My unwavering determination and skill with the great sword have struck fear into the hearts of those who would oppress the Nords of Skyrim. As I continue my crusade against the Thalmor, I'll also raid the occasional bandit output or explore the odd dungeon. An adventurer has to earn a wage, after all.",
