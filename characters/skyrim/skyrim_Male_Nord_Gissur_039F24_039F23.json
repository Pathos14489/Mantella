    "bio": "Gissur is a Nord beggar and Thalmor informant found at the Thalmor Embassy.\r\nHe is first encountered arguing with Rulindil in Elenwen's Solar during Diplomatic Immunity.\r\nIf Gissur is not killed in the Thalmor Embassy, he can later be encountered inside the Ratway Vaults during \"A Cornered Rat,\" where he will attack the Dragonborn. There, he carries a note with him.\r\nHe can also be found a different way during \"A Cornered Rat.\" If any of the patrons are asked for information regarding Esbern in the Ragged Flagon while Gissur is there, it will trigger an event where he then leaves the Ragged Flagon to meet with a Thalmor wizard accompanied by two Thalmor soldiers. He informs them that the Blades agent is in the Ragged Flagon asking about the old man.\r\nThe group of them then head to Ragged Flagon together. They will attack on sight, but if the Dragonborn manages to evade them, they will go into the tavern and ask where they might find the one asking about Esbern. The Flagon staff and Thieves Guild patrons refuse to cooperate, even after threats, and eventually the three Thalmor will leave. Gissur, however, remains behind and will from then on attack the Dragonborn on sight.",
