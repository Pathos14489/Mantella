    "bio": "Christer is a Nord man who is currently hiding in a supply closet on the ground level of the north tower of Mistwatch, which is an old fortress currently occupied by bandits. Mistwatch is located on the southern edge of Eastmarch. Christer has a thick brown beard.\r\nChrister is looking for his wife, Fjola, and will ask the player for assistance in finding and rescuing her. Bandits in the area have been kidnapping people and bringing them to Mistwatch. His wife Fjola disappeared about the time that the bandits began kidnapping people, and he believes she is being held hostage somewhere within the fort. He hopes his wife is still alive among the abducted. If the player agrees to help him, Christer will give the player a Mistwatch Key that a bandit guard recently dropped, which should be able to open any locked doors within the fort.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Please, stranger! I need your help!\"\r\n\"Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of the bandits. Please, you've got to help me!\"\r\n\"It's my wife, Fjola! I think she's being held in this tower.\"\r\n\u201cLet me explain. Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since. I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here. I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?\"\r\nIf asked if he is sure that his wife is here in Mistwatch: \"Honestly? I have no idea. But I've looked all over and the kidnappings here started around when she disappeared. So I have to hope...\"\r\nIf the player agrees to look for Fjola: \u201cThank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble. One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!\"\r\nIf the player says that Fjola is dead, and that they retrieved her wedding band: \"That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it? I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you.\"\r\nIf the player says that they couldn\u2019t find Fjola, but that they found her wedding band:\u201d Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here! I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you\u201d\r\nIf the player tells him that they killed Fjola: \u201cWhat? My Fjola would never... You monster! I'll kill you for this!\u201d",
