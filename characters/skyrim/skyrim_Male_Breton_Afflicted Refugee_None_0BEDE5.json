    "bio": "The Afflicted Refugee is a Breton villager who is traveling on the road west to leave Skyrim and return to his home in High Rock. He worships Peryite, the Daedric Lord of Pestilence. He is blessed with being afflicted by Peryite's wasting plague. His skin is covered in black encrustations. He has unusually red skin and the ability to vomit poison on enemies in combat.\r\nThis refugee is returning home to High Rock because The Afflicted's shepherd and leader (a Bosmer man named Orchendor) has lost his way and has turned from Peryite's commands. The refugee wants to get as far away from Orchendor and Skyrim as possible before Peryite removes his favor from the entire Afflicted group.\r\nDuring conversation, the Afflicted Refugee will likely suggest for the player to seek out Kesh the Clean. Kesh is camped out in The Reach at a Shrine of Peryite, west of the mining settlement of Karthwasten. Kesh is a Khajiit, and he is a respectable and devout worshiper of Peryite.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Are you finished ogling the grotesque? I suppose I should be grateful you didn't simply attack me.\"\r\n\"I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.\"\r\nIf asked where he's going: \"Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him. Kesh could tell you more. I just want out of Skyrim as quickly as possible.\"\r\nIf asked more than a few questions: \"I have no more time for talking. Go speak with Kesh if you are so curious.\"",
