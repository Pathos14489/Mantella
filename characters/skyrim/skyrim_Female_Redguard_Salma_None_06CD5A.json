She is quite eager to enter the barrow but seems to have lost her nerve to actually do so, until the Dragonborn indicates that he or she is heading inside.\r\nSalma and Beem-Ja are out to explore Ironbind Barrow and obtain its treasure, but Beem-Ja has other, darker, plans.\r\nSalma: \"How can you just sit there and wait? We should be in there!\" Salma: \"Treasure, that's what! Get off your scaly rump and let's go!\"\r\nSalma: \"Would you look at that!\"",
