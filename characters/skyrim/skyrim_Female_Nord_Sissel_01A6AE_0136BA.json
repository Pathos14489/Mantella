    "bio": "Sissel is a child who lives in the farming village of Rorikstead. She and her identical twin sister Britte can often be found running around the village. \r\nTheir father Lemkil often complains about how little his children help him with his farm. Their mother died in childbirth giving birth to them. Sissel often gets bullied by her twin sister Britte. She is also beaten by her abusive father, who insults her and says she is good for nothing.\r\nSissel has no friends of her age to play with. She is learning magic from the village elder Jouane Manette, who tells her that she has a talent for magic. Sissel sometimes has visions of a kind, elderly dragon.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one.\"\r\n\"I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary.\"\r\n\"Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.\"\r\nIf speaking to a stranger: \"I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want.\"",
