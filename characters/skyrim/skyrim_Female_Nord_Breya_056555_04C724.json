    "bio": "Breya was a Nord warrior and explorer who sought the Lexicon at the Dwemer Ruin of Avanchnzel. The expedition included Breya, From-Deepest-Fathoms, Watches-The-Roots, and Drennen. During the expedition she was killed by Dwarven Centurions.\r\nHer ghost can be seen throughout the ruins, and her body is found near the Lexicon's podium. Although at first firm in her job, she got more anxious as the expedition loses Drennen and they begin to fight more and more Dwarven Automatons. She was killed at the bottom of the ruin by a Centurion protecting the Lexicon.\r\n",
