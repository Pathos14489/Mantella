An adventurer by the name of Wyndelius Gatharian has gone missing in the barrow, and spirits have been spotted outside. Bringing Wilhelm Wyndelius's Journal will reward the Dragonborn with the Sapphire Dragon Claw that is required to travel further into Shroud Hearth Barrow.\r\nRomlyn Dreth, from Riften, asks the Dragonborn to deliver a stolen Black-Briar Mead Keg to Wilhelm.\r\nLifting the Shroud must be completed in order for Wilhelm to become available for marriage.\r\nWhere can I learn more about magic? \"I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me. I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.\"",
