    "bio": "Noster Eagle-Eye is an Imperial beggar living in the streets of Solitude.\r\nHe was once a scout who fought in the Great War, and claims he was on the battlefield when the Aldmeri Dominion attacked Anvil. During that battle, he was injured, losing his eye, and left by his comrades for dead. Due to his injury, he could no longer make a living and now lives destitute in Solitude.\r\nHe possesses extensive knowledge of the wilderness and is willing to share what he knows with the Dragonborn if his prized helmet he lost can be recovered.\r\nDo a favor by retrieving his helmet from a cave (chosen randomly from a list of four caves near Solitude). He rewards the return of his helmet with a skill increase in Sneak.",
