If she needs to fight, she will wield a war axe.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out.\"\r\n\"I have metal to dig.\"\r\n\"Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.\"\r\n\"Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.\"\r\n\"The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge.\"",
