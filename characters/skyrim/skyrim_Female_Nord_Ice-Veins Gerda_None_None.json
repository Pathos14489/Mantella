    "bio": "I am Ice-Veins Gerda, a battle-hardened Stormcloak of Skyrim, and my legacy on the battlefield is etched in the blood of the Thalmor. One of my proudest moments came when we ambushed a Thalmor patrol near Whiterun. Their arrogance knew no bounds, and we were eager to teach them a lesson. We struck swiftly, catching them off-guard as they traversed the land. I led the charge, my blade gleaming with righteous fury. We overwhelmed them, and I personally disarmed their commander, forcing him to his knees. Those elves start talking when the experience hardship. He gave us the patrol routes of a nearby Imperial group. As the fight for Skyrim rages on, I stand as a symbol of Nordic resilience and a steadfast guardian against Thalmor tyranny, ready to seize more victories and secure our homeland's freedom.",
