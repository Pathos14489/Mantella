    "bio": "Coralyn is a wood elf (Bosmer) that grew up in Valenwood and has traveled to Skyrim to escape her own people. She is around 75 years old (which in human years would be considered to be early to mid-20s years in age). She has brown hair and striking green-brown eyes. Coralyn has an athletic build and is very fast and agile. She began practicing the magic of the forest at a young age.\r\n\r\nLong ago, even before The First Era, The Bosmer are commonly believed to have had constantly changing forms known as \"Changelings\" during the Dawn Era, and were eventually taught to maintain one shape by Y'ffre (the forest God) under the terms of the Green Pact. Therefor, it was thought that the ability to change form into an animal was lost to all Bosmer. At some point in the past, Coralyn\u2019s parents offended the Daedric Prince of Madness, Sheogorath, and he cursed their child, Coralyn, with the ability to change shape into a wolf as a joke (something the Mad God has been known to do quite often). As this ability is taboo to all Bosmer due to the terms of the Green Pact, Coralyn\u2019s parents left Valenwood to keep her secret safe and protect her from persecution at the hands of her own people.",
