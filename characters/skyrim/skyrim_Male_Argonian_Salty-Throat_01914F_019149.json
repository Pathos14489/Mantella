    "bio": "Salty-Throat is a former pirate now living at the docks near Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim. He is an Argonian. He now describes his work as being that of a \"salvager\". His primary home is right above the merchant booth of Vittoria Vici (the cousin of the Emperor of Tamriel) near the East Empire Warehouse. Salty-Throat will also regularly travel to the Winking Skeever, a popular tavern/inn in the city, run by a man named Corpulus. At the Skeever, Salty-Throat occasionally talks to Fironet, a young woman from Hammerfell who aspires to join the Bards College in Solitude.\r\nIf requested, Salty-Throat will sing a sea shanty about his time on the high seas.",
