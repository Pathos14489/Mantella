He can be found in the final chamber of the tomb, along with a large number of draugr. He is the main antagonist of the quest \"Ancestral Worship.\"\r\nVals Veran uses teleportation spells quite a bit, and is very hard to hit consistently (using a Damage Magicka or a Decrease Magicka regeneration potion on a weapon is effective).",
