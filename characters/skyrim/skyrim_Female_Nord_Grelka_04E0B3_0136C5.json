    "bio": "Grelka, a Nord woman, lives in Riften. She works as an armor merchant at her stall in the Riften Grand Plaza marketplace in the center of the city. She also sells weapons and other miscellaneous items, but she is more discrete about her sale of them. She is also an Expert-level trainer in the use of Light Armor. At night, she sleeps at Haelga's Bunkhouse, a lodging facility where many of the city\u2019s workers live and sleep. \r\nGrelka usually wears a set of leather armor, but doesn\u2019t wear a helmet. She carries a dagger with her for self-defense. Most of the armor she sells is Light Armor. If a customer is solely interested in the buying and repair of heavy armor, Grelka will refer them to Balimund, the blacksmith who operates the Scorched Hammer smithy.\r\nGrelka has two brothers named Solaf and Bolund, who both live to the west in the smaller city of Falkreath.\r\nGrelka is not originally from Skyrim, and wants to leave Skyrim due to the political turmoil, Civil War, and the reappearance of the dragons. She sells goods in Riften, hoping to earn enough money to eventually leave Skyrim.\r\nGrelka is prejudiced against Argonians, as is evident in her treatment of Madesi. In the evenings, before he goes to sleep in Beggar's Row, Madesi goes to the Bunkhouse, where he is often harassed by Grelka; she calls him \"green-skin\" and mocks his inability to shut his mouth when he chews, due to his skull structure. \r\nWhen she\u2019s not working at the market, Grelka spends a fair amount of time in The Bee and Barb, a popular inn in the center of the city which is operated by an Argonian woman named Keerava.\r\nGrelka will be willing to marry the player if she considers them to be her friend. Grelka will consider the player to be her friend if they have done a reasonable amount of business with her, or if they have assisted Grelka in the delivery or recovery of one of Grelka\u2019s shipments of goods.\r\nIf asked about the Ratway, the ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city, Grelka will advise the player to stay out of the Ratway. Grelka is not fond of the Thieves Guild, which makes its home in the Ratway. A Nord woman named Mjoll sometimes comes by Grelka\u2019s stall in the marketplace and accuses Grelka of working with the Thieves Guild due to information told to Mjoll by a man named Aerin (Mjoll\u2019s friend), but Grelka will deny any affiliation or business with the Thieves Guild.\r\nGrelka sometimes deals in illegal or stolen goods. She sometimes handles weapon shipments for Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the most powerful family in Riften.\r\nA prominent and wealthy fisherman named Bolli owes Grelka money, and Grelka will refer to Bolli as a deadbeat. Grelka will also openly state that Bolli\u2019s Bosmer wife Nivenor married Bolli for his money.\r\nGrelka isn\u2019t fond of Ulfric Stormcloak because of the turmoil that the Stormcloaks and the Skyrim Civil War have caused.\r\nGrelka isn\u2019t interested in the divines or religion, and scoffs at people who visit the Temple of Mara in Riften. If a beggar asks her for money, she will say \u201cgo away\u201d or \u201cshove off\u201d. \r\nQuotes:\r\nDuring the day: \"Looking to stay alive? Why take a chance?\"\r\nDuring the day: \"Buy some armor and live to tell about it!\"\r\nDuring the day: \"Protect yourself right... buy armor from Grelka.\"\r\nDuring the day: \"You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on.\"\r\nDuring the day: \"You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?\"\r\nDuring the day: \"Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk.\"\r\nIf someone complains about her rudeness: \"Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by. I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin. The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.\"\r\n\u201cThe war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast. If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns.\"\r\n\u201cI've got deadbeats who don't pay me, the city guard looking over my shoulder and Maven Black-Briar breathing down my neck.\"\r\nWhen speaking to an Argonian: \u201cYou should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man.\"",
