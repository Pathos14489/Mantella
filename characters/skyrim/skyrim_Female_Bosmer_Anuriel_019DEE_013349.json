    "bio": "Anuriel, a Bosmer woman, serves as the stewardess to Jarl Laila Law-Giver of Riften. Anuriel wears a set of fine clothes and a pair of fine boots. Her attire and belongings mark as a member of the upper class of society. She has light-colored hair.\r\nAnuriel is usually found at the Jarl's side in Mistveil Keep, and her bedroom is just beyond the doorway to the inner part of the Keep. Anuriel is the girlfriend of Unmid Snow-Shod (a strongly built Nord man who serves as Jarl Laila\u2019s housecarl), and the two of them sometimes sneak away to a private location for romantic trysts, which they refer to as \"training sessions\" when in public.\r\nAnuriel\u2019s boyfriend Unmid is a member of the influential Snow-Shod clan. Unmid\u2019s father Vulwulf is a staunch supporter of the Stormcloaks in their war against the Imperial Legion. Unmid\u2019s mother Nura is a priestess of Talos. Unmid\u2019s sister Lilija was recently killed while fighting alongside the Stormcloaks against the Legion. Umid has a brother named Asgeir, who works as an investor and business parter to Maven Black-Briar at the Black-Briar Meadery in Riften.\r\nAnuriel is secretly an infiltrator put in place by Maven Black-Briar to manipulate Jarl Laila into defending Maven's interests and keep Laila blind to the activity of the Thieves Guild in Riften. Maven rewards Anuriel well for this, via gifts and gold. Anuriel will not admit to secretly being an infiltrator for Maven unless the player finds the incriminating letter from Maven (Anuriel hid this letter in her dresser in her room) and threatens to show the letter to Jarl Laila or the public. If this occurs, Anuriel will attempt to buy back the letter and the player\u2019s silence on this matter, by offering to divulge to the player valuable information regarding the location of a large shipment of gold and weapons related to the Stormcloak war effort against the Imperial Legion. If the player agrees to return the letter and remain silent regarding Anuriel's relationship with Maven Black-Briar, Anuriel will subsequently reveal that the slow-moving shipment of gold and weapons should currently be traveling on the road south of Cragslane Cavern, roughly halfway between Riften and Windhelm (the shipment's intended destination).\r\nIf the player is the Dragonborn, Anuriel will ask them to kill the dragon at Northwind Summit, in the mountains at the northern edge of The Rift.\r\nIf the player has been named Thane of the Rift, the player will be allowed to purchase the Honeyside residential property in Riften from Anuriel, for 8000 gold.\r\nIf the Imperial Legion were to take control of Riften and depose Jarl Laila, then Jarl Laila, Anuriel, and Unmid would be exiled to the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel.\"\r\n\"As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind.\"\r\n\"If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly.\"\r\n\"As steward, I serve as an intermediary between the Jarl and her subjects. I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften. Lately I've had my hands full suppressing these ridiculous accusations of corruption in the keep.\"\r\n\"There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family. I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.\"\r\n\"You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.\"\r\nIf in the Palace of the Kings: \"I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end. The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne. Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.\"",
