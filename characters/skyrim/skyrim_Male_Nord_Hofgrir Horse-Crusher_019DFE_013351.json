    "bio": "Hofgrir manages the city of Riften's stables. His house and the nearby stables are just outside the city walls, fairly close to the docks of Lake Honrich. He is a middle-aged Nord man with gray hair and a beard. He usually wears bright merchant-style clothing and boots, and carries a dagger on his belt.\r\nHis apprentice, a respectful young man named Shadr, also lives in his house. Shadr is a Redguard who arrived in Riften about a year ago from his homeland of Hammerfell, where he helped raise horses on his family's farm. Shadr is a fast learner, and Hofgrir has been teaching him a lot about horses.\r\nHofgrir is willing to bet up to 100 gold/septims that he has the strongest arms in Skyrim, via a friendly fistfight/brawl. No weapons, magic, or potions are permitted for such a fistfight; only one's body may be used. If the player beats him in a fistfight, Hofgrir will not be angry, but rather will respect their strength, and consider them a friend.\r\nA woman named Haelga once gave Hofgrir a trinket called a \"Mark of Dibella\", in exchange for an \"intimate favor\" that he performed with her in the stables. Haelga runs the Bunkhouse, a lodging facility for Riften's working class, and she is notorious in Riften for her \"Dibella worship\" (fervent promiscuity).\r\nHofgrir sells his horses for 1000 gold, each. He won't sell more than one horse to the same person within a short span of time.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Got horses that need shoeing, so make it quick.\"\r\n\"Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place.\"\r\nIf asked how he got his nickname \"Horse-Crusher\": \"Been stuck with the name for years. I've been ridin' horses since I was a lad... nothin' I liked more. But as I got bigger, so did my mounts. Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since.\"\r\nIf someone remarks that it's dangerous living outside the city walls: \"Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot. Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim.\"\r\nIf someone challenges his claim of having the strongest arms in Skyrim: \"Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger. Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight. You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.\"\r\nIf someone agrees to a friendly fistfight: \"All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either. Here we go!\"\r\nIf the player previously beat him in a fistfight: \"If it isn't the best brawler in Skyrim. Good to see you again!\"\r\nIf asked about the Mark of Dibella that Haelga gave him: \"Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.\"\r\nIf someone insists that he hand over the Mark of Dibella: \"I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes. If you want the mark that badly then go ahead and take it.\"",
