    "bio": "A deceased Imperial woman. Her body is found at a watering hole near Druadach Redoubt, in The Reach. Her body is lying on a rock, with her clothes lying nearby on the bank of the pool, along with a ring, an amulet, and a journal stating that she has disobeyed her father's wishes, despite the Forsworn activity in the area, and has gone for a swim. There are two Forsworn arrows floating in the watering hole, suggesting she was murdered by Forsworn raiders.",
