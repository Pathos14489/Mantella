    "bio": "Rayya is a Redguard warrior, who is appointed Housecarl to the Thane of Falkreath. She is first found in the Jarl's Longhouse.\r\nRayya can be asked to become a steward for a homestead. She is also a candidate for marriage.\r\nIf Lakeview Manor has been purchased, Rayya will stay there and, when not following the Dragonborn, patrol around the property, making for a handy extra fighter if the homestead is attacked by a dragon or a bandit.\r\nRayya wears steel armor and an Alik'r hood. In battle, she dual-wields scimitars by default, but will use other weapons if they are given to her. Her stats are average, but she specializes in one-handed weapons and heavy armor.",
