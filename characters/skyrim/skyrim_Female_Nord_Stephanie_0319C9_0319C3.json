Dagur's wife Haran helps Dagur run the inn. Dagur and Haran have a young daughter named Eirid. An Altmer man named Nelacar, who is a mage, permanently rents one of the rooms at the inn. The College of Winterhold, Skyrim's primary institution for magical learning, is Winterhold's main attraction, and most visitors to the Frozen Heart are in Winterhold on business relating to the college.\r\nStephanie is a Nord woman with long brown hair and blue eyes. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, Stephanie helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn. A young Breton woman named Valasca also works as a barmaid at the tavern.",
