    "bio": "Hermir Strong-Heart is a Nord and a blacksmith-in-training belonging to the Strong-Heart house located in Windhelm.\r\nShe is undergoing her training under Oengul War-Anvil, who she considers to be the best blacksmith in all of Skyrim. She is usually found next to the Blacksmith Quarters in Windhelm either on the grindstone or at the workbench.\r\nHermir will have very few dialogue options, with most of them either praising Oengul or Ulfric. She will give considerable praise to Ulfric Stormcloak, claiming him to be the savior of Skyrim.\r\nShe doesn't hide the fact that she enjoys the thought of Stormcloak soldiers using her swords to strike down Imperial soldiers.\r\nIf the Dragonborn drops a weapon near her, she will run up to the weapon, pick it up, and hand it back to them saying, \"...you're lucky I found this and not someone else or else it might have been lost for good.\" If the dragonborn drops armor near her, she will ask if she can keep it, and if allowed, will pick it up.\r\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion and finally defeats the Stormcloaks in Windhelm, Hermir will start to dislike them, stating that her \"blood boils\" every time she sees them.\r\nThe Dragonborn can still interact with her with one new dialogue option about her feelings now that Ulfric is dead. She will state that Ulfric was a true Nord, and stood for a free Skyrim. She also states that she won't hesitate to join in arms with a new leader against the Empire.\r\n ",
