    "bio": "Dagur, a Nord man, is the owner of The Frozen Hearth inn in Winterhold, where he serves food and drinks and rents out rooms to customers. He has blond hair, and wears typical barkeeper clothing. His wife Haran helps him run the inn. They have a young daughter named Eirid.\r\nJarl Korir, the ruler of Winterhold, sometimes visits the inn. Korir wife Thaena also serves as Korir\u2019s housecarl. Korir and Thaena have a son named Assur, who often plays with Eirid.\r\nDagur will often converse with customers and family around the inn. Unlike most of Skyrim's Nord population, Dagur is quite welcoming towards mages and magic in general. An Altmer mage named Nelacar, who is a former member of the College of Winterhold, has a permanent room at the inn.\r\nOne of the regulars at the inn is a man named Ranmir. Ranmir developed a serious drinking problem after the disappearance of his lover, a woman named Isabelle Rolaine. While Dagur\u2019s wife Haran feels less compelled to dig into Ranmir's past, Dagur would like to see the Ranmir get back on his feet, and for someone to find out what happened to Isabelle. Ranmir\u2019s sister, Birna, runs a general goods store across the street from the inn.\r\nThe College of Winterhold to the north is the town\u2019s main attraction. Winterhold used to be a considerably larger city, but 80 years ago a mysterious event called the Great Collapse caused the ground beneath the northern section of Winterhold to crumble and fall into the Sea of Ghosts. The College of Winterhold was the only structure on the north side of the city which was spared destruction. Winterhold is now a pale shadow of its former glory.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If you've business with the College, you're welcome to stay here. It's where most of our business comes from, in fact.\"\r\n\"Let me know if you need anything. We're here to provide.\"\r\n\"If there's anything you need, just let me know.\"\r\n\"Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go.\"\r\n\"Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble.\"\r\nIf asked about Winterhold: \"I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be. You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn. Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some.\"\r\nIf asked about Ranmir: \"Oh, Ranmir was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love. See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought. One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind. He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together. I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could?\u201d\r\nIf the Imperial Legion takes control of Winterhold: \u201cTurns out who runs Winterhold doesn't change much. Can't say I'm surprised. I won't complain about Korir being gone, but I don't expect things to really be any different.\"",
