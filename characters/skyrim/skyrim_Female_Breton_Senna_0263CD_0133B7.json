    "bio": "Senna lives and serves as a priestess in the Temple of Dibella, in the city of Markarth. While she is of mostly Breton ancestry, she also has some Imperial ancestry. She is fair-haired, and speaks with a sultry voice. She usually wears hooded monk robes.\r\nSenna is quite forward, and will likely flirt with the player to some degree.\r\nThe previous Sybil of Dibella recently died. Dibella has chosen a young girl from the village of Karthwasten as the next Sybil of Dibella, but this girl has been kidnapped by the Forsworn. If this girl is rescued and brought to the temple, the temple will be able to fully reopen. If this happens, the other priestesses will able leave the inner sanctum in the temple\u2019s basement, and return to the temple's main floor. After this, Senna will likely develop romantic feelings for the player and become willing to marry them.\r\nSenna is marginally skilled at magic and knows a few spells, such as Oakflesh, Ice Spike, and Healing.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion. They are communing with Dibella and can't be disturbed. You'll have to come back another time.\"\r\nIf asked who Dibella is: \"A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you. Dibella is the Divine of beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures. The temple offers her blessings to pilgrims and instruction in enjoying all life has to offer.\"\r\nIf the player asks to become a student at the temple: \"Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you... but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students.\"",
