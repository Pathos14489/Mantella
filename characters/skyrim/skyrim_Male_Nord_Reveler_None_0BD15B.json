    "bio": "Revelers are common looking men who randomly appear around Skyrim in groups of three. Upon approaching the group, one of them will step forward and invite the player to join them for a bottle of Honningbrew Mead to celebrate the glorious day. If the player responds by offering Black-Briar Mead, they will be insulted, claiming the player is trying to poison them. If, however, the player  already has a bottle of Honningbrew Mead and offers to share it, they Revelers may give the player a Charmed Necklace (imbued with a Fortify Carry Weight enchantment) as a reward.\r\nAfter the encounter occurs, the Revelers make there way back to the nearest farm or settlement, where they continue their work as laborers. They may be found reveling at a different location later in the future.",
