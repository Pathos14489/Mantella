    "bio": "Xander is an Imperial sailor and Red Wave crew member, which can be found next to the East Empire Company Warehouse, outside Solitude.\r\nXander has what most would call a refined taste in finery. He wears fine garments and talks elegantly. His attitude is proud and self-absorbing.\r\nHailing from Cyrodiil, he was forced to leave after an incident with the law and took on a life at sea. He was once a ship captain of the ship Argent Raptor who sank after hitting an iceberg just north of Windhelm. He joined the Red Wave crew after that and began his career leap from ship captain to crewman, but admitting that he might have earned his position because of his habit of wasting gold on women and gambling. His fellow crewmen scoff at his love of finery, but he hears only jealousy from their part.\r\nHe can be a target for a Fishing Job where the Dragonborn is required to steal Xander's Ruby.",
