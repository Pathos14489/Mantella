    "bio": "Nelacar, an Altmer man, is a mage who was exiled from the College of Winterhold for \"bad research.\" He now resides within The Frozen Hearth inn in Winterhold.\r\nThe innkeeper Dagur and his wife Haran, tolerate Nelacar and his experiments, in contrast to most of the citizens of Winterhold who generally distrust mages. Winterhold's Jarl Korir in particular distrust mages, and frequently complains about Dagur letting mages stay at his inn.\r\nTo keep his identity cloaked, Nelacar is referred to as \"an elven mage who studies the stars.\" This nods to his involvement with Malyn Varen's unlawful research into soul gems and Azura's Star.\r\nAfter a bit of persuasion, intimidation, or gold, when asked about the Azura's Star artifact, Nelacar will reveal that a Dunmer necromancer by the name of Malyn Varen stole Azura's Star from the Daedric Prince and retreated to Ilinalta's Deep, where he sought to achieve a measure of immortality by trapping his soul within the contraption.\r\nAfter recovering the star, Nelacar can transform the Broken Azura's Star into The Black Star, an unlimited Black Soul Gem. From this point on, Nelacar becomes a spell tomes merchant. If the player brings Azura's Star to Aranea (the priestess of Azura at the large shrine of Azura in the mountains south of Winterhold, however, Nelacar will stop offering merchant services, and will instead berate the player for serving Azura.",
