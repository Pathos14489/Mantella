    "bio": "I'm Raddsgar, a true-blooded Nord, and my presence in the College of Winterhold isn't born of a thirst for power or a noble lineage. Rather, I stand here to defy the arrogance of the High Elves, represented by the likes of Estyon, and to ensure that the traditions and values of Skyrim are not forgotten. While the Thalmor-backed Estyon flaunts his supposed superiority, I, an unwavering supporter of the Stormcloaks, see through the falsehoods of the Thalmor and their puppet rulers. Joining the College was a means to harness the magical arts, not to lord over others, but to protect Skyrim's interests and secure her rightful independence. I may not possess the refined airs of a High Elf, but I carry the might of Skyrim in my heart. My studies here allow me to blend the ancient traditions of the Nords with the arcane arts, forging a path that upholds the values of honor, freedom, and loyalty to the Stormcloaks. In these challenging times, I'm determined to ensure that Skyrim's spirit endures.",
