    "bio": "I am Coda, a son of Dragon's Bridge, born and raised amidst the rocky terrain and turbulent river waters of western Skyrim. My journey into the life of an adventurer began under the banner of duty, for I was once a proud guard of Dragon's Bridge, sworn to protect its people and uphold the law. As a guard, I defended our village from marauding bandits and kept a watchful eye on the treacherous wilderness that surrounds our humble home. But the longing for adventure stirred deep within my Nord heart. I left behind the familiar comforts of my post and set out to explore the untamed lands of Skyrim. One of my most notable feats came when I ventured into the treacherous depths of Valthume, an ancient Nordic tomb. There, I faced restless draugrs and uncovered long-forgotten secrets of our ancestors, earning the respect of fellow adventurers who sought the same treasures and knowledge. My combat style is that of a seasoned warrior, wielding a battleaxe with unmatched skill. It is with this weapon that I've confronted giants in the vast plains, battled fearsome frost trolls in the mountains, and fought off hordes of Forsworn in the Reach.",
