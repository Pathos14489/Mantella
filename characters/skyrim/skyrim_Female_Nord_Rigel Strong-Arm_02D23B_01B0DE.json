    "bio": "Rigel Strong-Arm is a bandit leader encountered at Pinewatch. Along with her fellow bandits, they have inhabited Pinewatch and the caverns beneath the farm. She may ambush the Dragonborn in the cavern system if she detects them.\r\nHer father asked her to join the military, reasoning that people would begin to notice the missing caravans that she has been raiding, and that she will eventually be caught. He also tells her to stop sending him money.\r\nShe replied via a letter, in which she claims that she will not join the Stormcloaks as they do not pay enough and she does not like the Imperial Legion.\r\nThe Dragonborn must retrieve a silver mold from a group of bandits in Pinewatch that she leads. The Dragonborn can take the Pinewatch Treasure Room Key from her body.",
