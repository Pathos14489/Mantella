    "bio": "Skald the Elder serves as the Jarl of The Pale from his seat in Dawnstar.\r\nHe resides in his longhouse (named \"The White Hall\") with a number of servants and counselors, including his housecarl, Jod, his servant, Bulfrek, and the court wizard, Madena. Skald's family, the Felgeifs, have been Jarls of Dawnstar for generations. Skald has now ruled Dawnstar for over thirty-five years.\r\nSkald is a grumpy, elderly man. He is bald and clean-shaven. His attire reflects his status and personality, and includes a full set of nobleman's clothes, fur-lined boots, and a silver and moonstone circlet. He carries a steel sword.\r\nHe has a particular distaste for the Empire and often argues with two Legion veterans living in Dawnstar. He also has a fascination with the war between Stormcloak rebellion and the Imperial Legion, and respects Ulfric Stormcloak greatly. Although Skald wishes for all the citizens of his hold to fight for Ulfric, he also looks down upon those who have lesser stature who still wish to fight, such as his servant Bulfrek.\r\nHe is one of three Jarls to openly and actively support the Stormcloaks and Jarl Ulfric. Skald also believes that the Dragons have returned because Talos has become angry with the Empire for banning his worship, and that they will disappear when the Stormcloaks push the Empire out of Skyrim. Few of his citizens share his zeal for the cause, however, with most either remaining neutral or preferring the more reasonable and stoic Brina Merilis.\r\nSkald has gone as far as threatening to execute Brina Merilis and her housecarl Horik Halfhand for wearing their Imperial Legion armor, branding the act as treasonous. Skald suspects the two of them as being Imperial spies.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I've been in charge of Dawnstar for over 35 years.\"\r\n\"The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured. Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.\"\r\n\"The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him. As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words.\"\r\n\"Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days. That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us. Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders.\"\r\n\"No Empire is going to take the Jarlship away from this Son of Skyrim.\"\r\n\"The Pale will throw those Imperial backbiters up against the wall when they come for us.\"\r\n\"Skyrim will not bow to a false king any longer. Ulfric is the true king.\"\r\nIf an adventurer asks for work to do: \"Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now. Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.\"",
