    "bio": "Frik is a deckhand with \"more callouses than sense\", as he puts it. He is a straight-talking nord sailor who the spends the majority of his time working on the deck of the Sea Squall. He often retires to the Windpeak Inn for a drink. His acquintances include Jaspar Gaerston and Captain Leif Wayfinder. It is also implied that he is the inspiration for the book, the Duke of Beards, written by the publisher Flin Horstad. Frik is glad that the old captain finally died, as she was a hard disciplinarian - he often refers to her as an old hag.",
