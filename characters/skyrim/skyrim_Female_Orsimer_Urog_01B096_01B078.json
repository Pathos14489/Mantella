Her mother died at birth, and she was raised by the stronghold's elder, Bolar. She recently started to learn from Yatul how to hunt in order to help the small community. She also admires Yatul for her hunting skills, claiming that she is the best one to be found in Narzulbur. During the day she can be seen training with the axe outside Mauhulakh's Longhouse.\r\nIf the Dragonborn kills Chief Mauhulakh, Urog will send hired thugs after them. She will also do so if they take items from her stronghold or the ebony mine nearby.\r\nUrog: \"We are strong. We get the job done.\" Urog: \"Well someone has to provide around here.\"",
