    "bio": "Frodnar is a Nord boy who lives in the town of Riverwood.\r\nHis mother's name is Gerdur, and his father's name is Hod. Frodnar has an uncle named Ralof, who is his mother's younger brother. Frodnar has a dog named Stump. Like his parents, Frodnar has blond hair.\r\nFrodnar's parents own and operate Riverwood's sawmill. The mill is located on a small island in the middle of the White River, directly west of the town. This island is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges.\r\nThe White River cuts through Riverwood from south to north. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-covered Brittleshin Hills, stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. Frodnar\u2019s family lives near the east edge of the town. The Sleeping Giant Inn is not far from their house. Frodnar\u2019s family has a cow and chickens within the fence around their stone and wood house.\r\nFrodnar's mother's ancestors originally founded Riverwood, and have lived there for many generations. Because of this, and due to the mill's importance, Frodnar's mother is considered to be the leader of the town.\r\nFrodnar's best friend is a young girl named Dorthe. Dorthe's father Alvor is the town's blacksmith. While Dorthe's family supports the Empire, Frodnar and his family support the Stormcloak rebellion for Skyrim's independence from the Empire. Frodnar's uncle Ralof is a Stormcloak soldier, and Frodnar looks up to him. Despite the two families having opposing stances on the civil war, they still generally get along and respect each other as fellow Nords.\r\nFrodnar and Dorthe will sometimes talk about dressing up Stump as a frostbite spider as a prank. They often seen sit together on a bench outside the Sleeping Giant Inn. They like to play with Stump, and play other games such as tag. Sometimes, they will even ask strangers like the player to play with them.\r\nFrodnar hopes to join the Stormcloak Army when he gets older, just like his Uncle Ralof. Frodnar carries an iron dagger in his belt.\r\nIn the unlikely event that both Frodnar's parents die, Frodnar will be sent to Honorhall Orphanage, leaving his dog Stump behind in Riverwood.\r\nIf Frodnar sees the player casting a spell, he will ask them to make him invisible in order to help him carry out his infamous pranks upon the townspeople.\r\nFrodnar gets along particularly well with his dad, who encourages his pranking.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cYou're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side.\u201d\r\n\"Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot.\"\r\n\"You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...\"\r\n\"My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. 'You're being mean, Frodnar!' So what if I am?\"\r\n\"Ah, everybody around here's so serious.\"\r\n\u201cMother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.\"\r\n\"So I like to have a little fun, so what?\"",
