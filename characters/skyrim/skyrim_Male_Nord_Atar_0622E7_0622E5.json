    "bio": "Atar, a Nord man, works as a mercenary for the Silver-Blood Family, and is stationed at the mining settlement of Karthwasten in the northeast section of the Reach.\r\nThe mayor of Karthwasten, a middle-aged Nord man named Ainethach, refuses to sell Sanuarach Mine to the Silver-Blood family. The Silver-Bloods generously sent mercenaries to guard it against attacks from Forsworn raiders. As compensation for this generosity, the Silver-Bloods want Ainethach to sell the mine to them, in order to pay for their services.\r\nThe player may try to persuade, bribe, or intimidate Atar into leaving Karthwasten. Alternatively, the player can instead team up with Atar and attempt to convince Ainethach to sell the mine to the Silver-Bloods.\r\nAfter this dispute is resolved, Atar will likely head to the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cForsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up. We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work.\"\r\n\u201cThe Silver-Blood family the most important people in the Reach. They practically own the city of Markarth. And we're here on their coin.\"\r\n\"I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.\"\r\n\"The Silver-Bloods have made Ainethach a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest he takes it.\"",
