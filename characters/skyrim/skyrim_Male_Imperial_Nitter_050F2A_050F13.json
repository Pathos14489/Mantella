    "bio": "Nitter is a pathetic Imperial man who works as the assistant to the lighthouse keeper Ma\u2019zaka. Nitter will move from inside the lighthouse to tending the flame. Psychologically he is easily manipulated due to a deep loneliness and wanting to fit in. For him, it\u2019s the joy of having someone muss his hair, even when the fingers are coarse. Nitter will commit crimes and will act against his own interests, because for him, nothing is as euphoric as the feeling that he belongs.",
