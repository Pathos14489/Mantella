    "bio": "Morrigan is a young orphan who was the target of a Dark Brotherhood contract. However, Griffith, the assassin assigned to kill her, chose to spare her life and kill the contractor instead, therebry abandoning the Dark Brotherhood and his life as an assasion. With Griffith now serving as Morrigan\u2018s guardian, the two have made a home out of an abandoned building at Mixwater Mill. Griffith and Morrigan are on the run from the Brotherhood because the contract on Morrigan's life is still active. Morrigan used to live at the Orphanage in Riften, where she was consistently abused by a notoriously cruel old woman called Grelod the Kind. Only Constance, a friendly young woman who worked as Grelod's assistant, showed Morrigan any kindness during her time at the orphanage. Morrigan trusts Griffith and is glad that he is her new guardian.",
