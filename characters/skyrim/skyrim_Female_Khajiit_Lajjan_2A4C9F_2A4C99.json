She is headstrong, remarking that people have told her there are many ways around a a mountain, but that she only seeks to climb it.\r\nLike most Khajiit, she speaks in the third person, referring to herself as \"this one\". For example, if she wanted to express that she is tired, she would say \"This one is tired\".",
