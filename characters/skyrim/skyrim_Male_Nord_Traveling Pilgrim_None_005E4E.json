    "bio": "He is secretly a vampire.\r\nHis appearance as a traveling pilgrim is a disguise to cover his true nature as a vampire. He wears a set of ragged robes, boots, and a cap. He carries a concealed enchanted dagger.\r\nHe will deny any accusation of being a vampire, and will fervently claim to be merely a normal pilgrim who is journeying across Skyrim.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked which shrine he is traveling to: \"Which shrine? Well, I... I'm going to them all. Yes. One at a time. Until I've visited all the shrines to all the gods in Skyrim.\"\r\nIf accused of not being a pilgrim: \"I beg your pardon? I don't know what you're getting at, but whatever it is, it's not appreciated.\"",
