    "bio": "Glover Mallory, a Breton man, is a blacksmith living in Raven Rock, on the island of Solstheim. He is the father of Sapphire, brother of Delvin Mallory, and a member of the Thieves Guild.\r\nHe is found at the Blacksmith's shop upon first arriving at Raven Rock. Just like the other villagers of Raven Rock, he can also be found at the Earth Stone working on it and worshiping at it. When he does, he acts and sounds like he has been indoctrinated.\r\nGlover will give a quest to retrieve his Ancient Nordic Pickaxe from Crescius Caerellius, after having it stolen from him, and also give it as a reward for the quest, claiming he has no use for it. It is also implied that he stole the pickaxe from the Skaal Village.\r\nHe gives the quest to retrieve the Bonemold Formula from Esmond Tyne in Castle Karstaag Caverns, assuming the player is a member of the Thieves Guild.\r\nAfter the completion of this quest he allows access to his basement, which is filled with rare items including the Blackguard's Armor and a Thief Cache. There is a note to Sapphire in his basement, which reveals that he is Sapphire's father. It is also worth noting that, according to the Bonemold Formula, he has a younger sister.\r\nIf you talk to Sapphire in The Ragged Flagon - Cistern, after taking the letter, there will be an option to give her the letter. If you do give it to her, she will reward you with an Exquisite Sapphire; a unique item.\r\nGlover Mallory can be a potential recipient of Geldis Sadri's sujamma that he asks of the player to give out to the people of Raven Rock.\r\n",
