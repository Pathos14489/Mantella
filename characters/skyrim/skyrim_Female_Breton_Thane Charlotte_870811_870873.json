    "bio": "Charlotte lives in Morthal, where she holds the title of Thane along with her husband, Thane Valund. She is a Breton, with brown hair and green eyes. Like many Breton women, she is quite short. She has two parallel scar marks that start on her nose and extend towards her left eye. She wears expensive fine clothing, and speaks with a calm voice.\r\nMorthal is the capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Hjaalmarch's terrain consists mostly of the Drajkmyr salt marshes in its northern half, and mountainous snowy tundra in its southern half. Morthal lies in between these two halves, with the River Hjaal running through the town.\r\nCharlotte and her husband Valund (a Nord) own the Must-Foot Winery in Morthal, and employ an energetic young woman named Marla to help them run it. Valund is particularly passionate about wine.",
