    "bio": "Felldir the Old was a Nordic hero who helped overthrow the dragons in ancient times. He can be seen on the Throat of the World and in Sovngarde. He wears a Greybeard's Robe and uses an Ancient Nord Greatsword.\r\nAlong with Gormlaith Golden-Hilt and Hakon One-Eye, Felldir encountered Alduin at the Throat of the World, hoping to banish him forever. Felldir felt that it was not possible to defeat Alduin with Dragonrend alone, and brought an Elder Scroll to banish Alduin with. His suspicions proved correct when one of his comrades was slain by the dragon. Unwittingly, he sent Alduin into the future, thus setting in motion the events that caused the Dragon Crisis in 4E 201, and creating a time wound in the process.\r\nAfter recovering an Elder Scroll from Blackreach, the Dragonborn used it atop the Throat of the World. The scroll opened a window into the memory of Felldir's battle against Alduin, where the Dragonborn learned the Dragonrend shout and witnessed the events that brought Alduin into the Fourth Era.\r\nLater, when the Dragonborn entered Sovngarde, Felldir assisted in defeating Alduin.\r\nFelldir can be summoned to aid the Dragonborn with the Call of Valor shout.",
