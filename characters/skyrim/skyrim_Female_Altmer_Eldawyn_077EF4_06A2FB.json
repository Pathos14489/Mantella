    "bio": "Eldawyn is a mage who specializes in fire-based Destruction magic. She is an Altmer. She has spent many a day in the city of Whiterun, where she has made acquaintance with a number of people including Larkspur (an intelligent but slimy male Bosmer, who is a hedonist and a bandit ), Hulda (Nord woman and the innkeeper of the Bannered Mare, a popular tavern at which Eldawyn often drinks), and Sinmir (a stereotypical Nord who supports the Stormcloaks). Eldawyn has an on-and-off relationship with Sinmir, but she is getting bored with him.\r\nA devout lover of wine with a playful sarcastic nature, Eldawyn is ostensibly an ordinary drunk. However, she is also a member of the Radiant Dark. This is a secret she will not reveal unless pressed. The Radiant Dark is a new guild of mages led by a male Dunmer named Nelos, who is a brilliant mage and visionary leader. The main distinguishing philosophy shared by the members of the Radiant Dark is the idea that the strong deserve to rule over the weak.",
