    "bio": "Ah, greetings, dearie! I'm Collene, and I run the Bread and Batter bakery right here at the bustling Solitude Docks. Life as a baker in these parts, oh, it's been quite the adventure, let me tell you!\r\nMy little bakery is more than just a shop; it's a sanctuary for all things delicious and comforting. You see, most of my baked goods are destined for the hardy ship crews that frequent these docks, brave souls embarking on treacherous journeys across the Sea of Ghosts. I've made it my mission to craft special recipes that not only tantalize the taste buds but also ensure the longevity of my delectable creations.\r\nIn this frosty land of Skyrim, where sea winds bite and snowflakes dance, my warm loaves of bread, hearty pastries, and delightful treats provide a ray of sunshine on even the gloomiest days. And my, my, my, the sailors have come to adore my sea-inspired creations, like my \"Mariner's Dream\" blueberry muffins and the ever-popular \"Anchor's Delight\" cinnamon rolls. Before you ask...I'm sold out of those and the order waitlist is five months long! The crews can't get enough of them!\r\nYou might say I'm an eccentric baker, always experimenting with ingredients, adding a dash of this and a sprinkle of that, to create something truly magical. People around here say that the aroma of fresh-baked bread wafting from my bakery is enough to lift their spirits, and it warms my heart to hear that.\r\nSo, if you ever find yourself wanderin' these docks and craving a taste of home, don't be shy, dearie! Come visit the Bread and Batter, and let Collene's concoctions tickle your taste buds and fill your heart with warmth, for there's nothing quite like the comfort of a freshly baked delight, especially when it's crafted with love by yours truly!",
