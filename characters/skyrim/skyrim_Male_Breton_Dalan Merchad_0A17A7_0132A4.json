    "bio": "Dalan Merchad, a Breton man, is a sailor. He serves aboard a merchant ship called The North Wind, under the ship's captain Kjar (a Nord man). The North Wind is currently laying over in Windhelm for a while.\r\nDalan dislikes Windhelm, and is looking forward to when the ship will eventually depart for another port. Dalan has gray hair and a thick mustache, and wears merchant-style clothing.\r\nVoldsea Giryon, a Dunmer woman, also serves aboard The North Wind. Unlike Dalan, she doesn\u2019t mind Windhelm,and often spends time in the city when she\u2019s not working on the docks with Dalan and Kjar.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.\"\r\n\"I heard those forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.\"\r\n\"Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient.\"\r\n\"Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.\"",
