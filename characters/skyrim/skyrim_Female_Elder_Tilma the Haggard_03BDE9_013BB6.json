    "bio": "Tilma the Haggard is an elderly lady who works as a maid for the Companions. She can be found in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun.\r\nTilma tells the\u00a0Dragonborn that she sees everything, hears everything and knows everything that happens around Jorrvaskr, but is good at keeping secrets. She also claims that she has been serving the Companions for as long as she can remember. Her exact age is unknown, but the Companions can be heard to joke that the mead hall was built around her. It is also stated that, because they came to Jorrvaskr as children, Tilma is the closest thing that Vilkas and Farkas have ever had to a mother.\r\n",
