    "bio": "Deekus, an Argonian man, lives by himself at a small campsite near Hela's Folly. Hela\u2019s Folly is the site of a large shipwreck located on the northwest tip of a fairly large island within the Sea of Ghosts, just north of Skyrim\u2019s northern coast. An ancient Nord ruin named Yngvild is also located at the center of this island. Many smaller islands surround this island. The nearest city to Hela\u2019s Folly is Dawnstar, to the southwest. The sea between these islands and Skyrim\u2019s mainland is frozen over and traversable by foot for much of the year, though this doesn\u2019t matter much to Deekus since he is an Argonian and would have no trouble swimming to the mainland if he needed to.\r\nDeekus wears a set of hide armor. He can often be found sitting in his chair at his camp. He is a scavenger and a treasure hunter who has been retrieving items from the nearby shipwreck. There are a number of gemstones and valuables spread around his camp, such as a gold Dibella Statue. Deekus keeps a few bear traps around his camp, helping to guard his camp from the local wildlife.\r\nDeekus is quite possessive of the shipwreck near his camp, and will not be willing share the spoils of the ship with anyone.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Hrm. You go find your own wreck. This one's mine.\"\r\n\"Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!\"\r\n\"Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!\"",
