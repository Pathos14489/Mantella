    "bio": "Vilja is a young Nord woman hailing from the island of Solstheim. She has blue-gray eyes long golden hair, the braids of which are typically draped over her shoulders. She dreams of becoming a bard, though that dream is not what has brought her here to Skyrim. Vilja is a good and pure-hearted girl, sometimes so naive as to appear childlike. Despite being a capable fighter, she's not a tough badass type - rather, she's quite traditionally girly, often concerned with her looks and in need of attention. She tries to come across as cute. Both her and her quest, despite some more dramatic implication, are rather on the light-hearted side. She is an elgible bachelorette, though it will considerable time and effort for a potential spouse to win her heart. She cares more about love than lust.",
