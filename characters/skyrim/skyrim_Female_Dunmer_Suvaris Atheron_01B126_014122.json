    "bio": "Suvaris Atheron is a Dunmer employed by Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. Suvaris lives in Windhelm and can be found in the Atheron Residence, in the New Gnisis Cornerclub, or running the Shatter-Shield Office at the Windhelm Docks. She is the sister of Aval Atheron and Faryl Atheron.\r\nUpon entering the city, she is seen being accused of spying for the Imperials by two Nords, evidence of the prejudice against the Dark Elves that are prominent in Windhelm. This also shows the paranoia of many of Skyrim's Nords.\r\nIn her logbook, she states that she punished one of the Argonian dockers for laziness by withholding food for two days, something she may also comment on by stating \"These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.\" She apparently knows about Stands-In-Shallows' Skooma supply and uses this as a means to keep the Argonians motivated.\r\nThe Dragonborn must steal her Logbook. In addition to quest-related info, she writes down all her meals as well as her methods of punishing her laborers. Orthus Endario describes her as \"meticulous to a fault.\"",
