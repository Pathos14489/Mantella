    "bio": "Milore Ienth is a\u00a0Dunmer alchemist living in Raven Rock. She is married to Garyn Ienth.\r\nJust like the other villagers of Raven Rock, she can be found at the Earth Stone working on it and worshiping it. When she does, she acts and sounds like she has been indoctrinated.\r\nAfter the Red Mountain erupted, she and her husband Garyn Ienth fled to Morthal. It was there that she was taught by the local alchemist Lami in the arts of creating potions. After a few years living in Morthal, she and her husband heard of the Dunmer colony of Raven Rock, packed their bags and haven't looked back since. Soon after arriving in Raven Rock she and her husband opened up the most essential of Raven Rock's farms.\r\nOnce freed from the indoctrination during the quest \"Cleansing the Stones\" she exclaims \"You sure showed Miraak who's in charge around here!\"\r\nI have that netch jelly for you. \"Goodness, it must have been quite difficult tracking those creatures down out there. Here, take these. They should help you during your journeys.\"\r\nDo you know someone called Miraak? \"I don't think so, though it sounds like a name I've heard before...\"",
