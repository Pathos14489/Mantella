    "bio": "A high elf tailor found on the lower level of Riften. Whilst seemingly an ordinary tailor, he has a dark secret he will not reveal unless caught out or prevented with physical evidence of the crimes he has committed. This secret is that he is secretly a master of enchantment, who has captured living people to use as substitute bodies. He refers to these people as \u2018clothes\u2019, having removed their souls. This process involved Necromancy and Black Soul Gems. To keep the soulless bodies fresh, he has turned to restoration to keeping them in top condition. Although outwardly friendly, he is deeply and coldly psychopathic.",
