    "bio": "Lodvar lives in Dragon Bridge, where he works as a lumberjack at the mill that his brother Horgeir owns.\r\nLodvar is a strong Nord man with long bright red hair. He lives in the same house as Horgeir and Olda, Horgeir's wife.\r\nLodvar's brother has a drinking problem, and has been racking up debts because of it. Horgeir sometimes even embarrasses himself by leaving the local tavern without paying for his drinks. This tavern is called the Four Shields Tavern, and is run by a woman named Faida.\r\nThe town of Dragon Bridge is located in Haafingar, southwest of the city of Solitude. Solitude is the provincial capital of Skyrim. To the southeast of Dragon Bridge there is a long stone bridge that spans the chasm overlooking the Karth River, which marks the boundary between Haafingar and Hjaalmarch holds. The town is named after this bridge. The lumber mill is near this bridge.\r\nLodvar's brother's wife Olda is a lovely and sensible woman with long black hair. Lodvar and Olda have been having an affair. Lodvar sometimes takes Olda for a romantic picnic up the mountain, where they drink wine and sleep together. Horgeir is oblivious to this. Most of the inhabitants of Dragon Bridge now know that Horgeir's wife is cheating on him, but they don't have the heart to give him the bad news.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Keep walking, stranger.\"\r\n\"If you're looking for handouts, look somewhere else.\"\r\n\"Got nothing to spare for travelers nor refugees, here.\"\r\n\"You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me.\"",
