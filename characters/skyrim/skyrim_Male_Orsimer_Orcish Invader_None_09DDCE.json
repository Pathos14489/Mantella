Many are encountered during the quest \"Waking Nightmare\" in Nightcaller Temple.\r\nThe Orcish Invaders were a group of Orcs that suffered the same nightmares as those in Dawnstar. In an ill-fated attempt to end their nightmares they made an assault on Nightcaller Temple, but were later left unconscious after Erandur, the former Priest of Vaermina, released The Miasma, as shown during the Dreamstride of the Dragonborn.\r\nDuring the quest \"Waking Nightmare,\" they are usually found on the ground unconscious with a set number of Vaermina Devotees.",
