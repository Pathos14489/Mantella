    "bio": "Niluva Hlaalu is a Dunmer found in Riften. A suggested member of Dunmeri House Hlaalu, Niluva lives in Haelga's Bunkhouse and works at the Black-Briar Meadery. She is a Skooma addict, and is worried Indaryn will fire her because so.\r\nEvery time the Dragonborn tries to speak to her, she demands not to be judged. Her other dialogue would suggest that she is the daughter of Belyn Hlaalu, a farmer in Windhelm. It also appears that she borrows money from others to pay for her addiction, referenced in a conversation between her and Tythis.\r\nTythis: \"Niluva, you promised you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?\" Niluva: \"Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.\" Tythis: \"If you'd stop wasting your coin on that Skooma, you'd have enough gold to live on!\" Niluva: \"Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow.\"\r\nNiluva: \"Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said that if I'm late one more time, he's going to kick me out the door!\" Niluva: \"What do you mean?\" Romlyn: \"All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push too far one day and they're going to push back...hard.\"",
