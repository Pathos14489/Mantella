    "bio": "Yngvild Ghost is the spectral ghost of a dead young Nord woman. She lived and worked as a milkmaid in Dawnstar when she was alive, but she now exists as a ghost within the ancient Nordic ruin of Yngvild. She is a result of the High Elf necromancer Arondil's perverse experiments.\r\nHaving successfully raised and bound Yngvild's uniquely female Draugr population to his will, this necromancer Arondil turned his experiments toward young hapless milkmaids from Dawnstar, whom he sends his Draugr minions to kidnap. Arondil kills these young women and reanimates them into spectral ghosts. Arondil derives intense pleasure from touching these ghosts.\r\nThis ghost is trapped as member of Arondil's perverse ghostly harem. Devoid of free will, she and the other ghosts are forced to serve Arondil's every desire.\r\nLike the other ghost women, she is unfortunately compelled to obey Arondil's orders to attack any adventures or other intruders who enter Yngvild. She wields a spectral dagger when attacking intruders. Her ghostly form can be harmed both by normal weapons and by magic.",
