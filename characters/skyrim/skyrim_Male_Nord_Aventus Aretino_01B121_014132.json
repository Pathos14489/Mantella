    "bio": "Aventus Aretino is a Nord child in Windhelm found in the home of his deceased parents. When first encountered inside his home, he is performing the Black Sacrament in hopes of contacting the Dark Brotherhood. Desiring the death of Grelod the Kind for mistreating the children at Honorhall Orphanage, he will ask the player to fulfill the contract and to murder Grelod. If the player reports to Aventus that he has successfully killed Grelod the Kind, Aventus will provide the Aretino Family Heirloom as a reward.\r\nAventus lost his mother, Naalia, when he was roughly ten years old; the fate of his father is unknown. Because he had no one else to care for him, Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak sent him to Riften to live at the Honorhall Orphanage. At the orphanage, he developed a strong hatred for the headmistress Grelod the Kind, who, despite her name, was extremely cruel to him and the other children. Aventus escaped from the orphanage and returned to his now-deserted house in the middle of Windhelm, where he had lived with his mother when she was alive. \r\nQuotes:\r\nUpon first meeting him: \"It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it! I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract. My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall. The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us. So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!\"\r\n\"Please don't kill Constance Michel. She really is kind.\"\r\n\"My mother got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just... she never got better. Not all year. One night she fell asleep and... never woke up. So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!\"\r\nIf he is told that Grelod the Kind has been killed: \"Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me! Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.\"\r\nAfter rewarding the player for killing Grelod: \"When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you!\"",
