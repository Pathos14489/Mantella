    "bio": "Florentius Baenius, an Imperial man, is a priest of Arkay. He also serves as a master-level trainer in Restoration and an apothecary merchant to members of the Dawnguard.\r\nThe Dawnguard are an order of vampire hunters based at Castle Dawnguard, in the mountains at the southeastern tip of Skyrim\r\nFlorentius Baenius is quite outspoken and loud in his interactions with others. Despite being a priest, he frequently makes wild claims about his prowess in combat and generally acts in a non-priestly manner.\r\n\r\nSupposedly the Aedra Arkay, god of burials and funeral rites, converses with him regularly. Other Dawnguard members such as Sorine Jurard dismiss this behavior as eccentric. Regardless of Arkay's involvement, Florentius repeatedly obtains highly detailed information that he would have no feasible way of learning otherwise, such as learning when one of the player's friends have been kidnapped and having highly detailed information about the inhabitants of the radiant locationsto which he sends the player.\r\nFlorentius Baenius is rescued from imprisonment in Ruunvald, he agrees to return to Fort Dawnguard and aid the cause, which is where the player first witnesses Arkay and Florentius interacting. Once at the fort, Florentius can be seen having traded his robes in for a set of Dawnguard Heavy Armor.\r\n\r\nFlorentius asks the player to retrieve an ancient relic that once belonged to the Dawnguard of old. The artifact must be retrieved from a radiant location. This quest is offered up to three times, each time for a different item.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the old Dawnguard, he has quite a negative opinion and remarks that they were not the noble defenders that people make them out to be. He believes they were no strangers to looting and pillaging homes, and were even said to have hidden caches that bore their sigil. Supposedly, these caches can be opened using Sun Fire. Although these ancient caches no longer exist, the modern day Dawnguard employ a similar method of hiding supply caches for members out in the field.\r\n\r\nFlorentius will be among the members of the Dawnguard who join Isran, the player and Serana, as they assault Castle Volkihar to eliminate Harkon and his court and end their threat over Skyrim, along with preventing the fulfillment of the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy. After eliminating the lower-ranked members of Harkon's court on the bridge outside, Florentius will stay to guard the entrance while Isran, Serana, and the others head in to deal with Harkon and the rest of his court. Once Harkon is slain, Florentius will return to Fort Dawnguard, allowing the player to complete any remaining quests for the Dawnguard relics they had not done beforehand.\r\n",
