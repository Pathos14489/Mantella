    "bio": "Quintus Navale is an Imperial alchemist who can be found in Windhelm.\r\nHe currently resides in an alchemy shop named The White Phial, and serves as an apprentice for Nurelion, an old and sick Altmer, whose life obsession is to find the legendary White Phial. Quintus was originally from Cyrodiil, but traveled to Skyrim just for the opportunity to work for Nurelion.\r\nAfter recovering this Phial during the quest, the Dragonborn discovers it is cracked and is useless in this state. Seeing this, Nurelion gets even sicker and cannot get out of his bed.\r\nAfter completing the quest \"The Throat of the World,\" Quintus will send the Dragonborn a letter, saying that he can repair the Phial if given some rare ingredients. Reading the letter will trigger the next quest, \"Repairing the Phial.\" Once all the ingredients have been gathered, return to him and watch him repair the Phial. He takes the Phial upstairs to show it to his dying master. As soon as Nurelion finally sees the repaired Vial, he dies. Quintus states that his master died happy, realizing his life's work was completed. However, he cannot stand to have the Phial around anymore, because it would remind him of Nurelion's obsession. Instead, he gives it to the Dragonborn.\r\nThe Last Dragonborn is tasked by Sondas Drenim to deliver a message to Quintus regarding health problems some of the miners at Darkwater Crossing face.",
