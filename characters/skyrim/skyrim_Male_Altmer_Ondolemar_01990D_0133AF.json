    "bio": "Ondolemar is a Thalmor Justiciar located in the Understone Keep within Markarth, the capital of The Reach.\r\nOndolemar is the head of the Justiciars in Skyrim, and is charged with advancing Thalmor interests in Skyrim's major city of Markarth, seeking to persecute all Talos worshippers within the city. He resides in Understone Keep, where he often paces back and forth near the Jarl's throne under the escort of two Thalmor Soldiers.\r\nWhen spoken to, he speaks of his belief in the superiority of Mer over Men, of his contempt of the Empire, and of his belief that Talos does not deserve a place within the pantheon of the Divines, as Talos was a human before his ascendancy. He firmly believes that all Talos worship in Skyrim can be purged, despite the \"stubbornness\" of the Nords.\r\nIf the player mentions having killed Thalmor justiciars in the past, expresses a belief in the divinity of Talos, or wears an Amulet of Talos, Ondolemar will become offended and attack the player.\r\nOndolemar may ask the player to locate evidence of Talos worship being conducted by an old Nord man named Ogmund. If the player provides Ondolemar with sufficient evidence for Ogmund to be arrested for the crime of Talos worship, Ondolemar will subsequently reward the player with gold, as well as increase Ondolemar's disposition towards the player to the level of a friend.\r\nOndolemar somtimes attends Ambassador Elenwen's parties at the Thalmor Embassy west of Solitude. If the player has helped Ondolemar at the past and asks Ondelemar for a favor while at a party , Ondolemar will grant the player's favor (within reason).",
