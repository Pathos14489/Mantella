    "bio": "Arisse lives in the town of Dragon Bridge, where she works as a barmaid at the Four Shields Tavern. She is employed by the owner of this tavern/inn: a woman named Faida. A local teenage Breton girl named Julienne Lylvieve is Faida's apprentice, training to be an innkeeper like her. A woman named Teretia also works as a barmaid at the tavern.\r\nArisse is a Redguard woman with green eyes and long strawberry blonde hair. Her skin is noticeably lighter than most Redguards, though still a bit darker than Skyrim's native Nord population. At work, Arisse wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, she helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.",
