    "bio": "I am Ondrls Tarvanabibi, once a proud Ashlander of the Zainab tribe in Morrowind. A blacksmith by trade. Our lives were intertwined with the rhythms of the Ashlands, a land as unforgiving as it was sacred. The eruption of Red Mountain shattered our world, leaving behind desolation and loss. Many of us, like my steadfast wife Ashana and I, turned our eyes to Skyrim, hoping for a fresh start away from both the destruction of Vvardenfell and the prejudice that plagued us in Skyrim's Windhelm. In Windhelm, the Nords' mistrust cut deep, branded by our Ashlander heritage. We longed for acceptance, to escape the prejudiced gaze that lingered there. The winds of destiny guided us to a secluded place in Eastmarch. With Ashana's unwavering support, we helped found New Zainab, drawing on the teachings of our Ashlander upbringing.",
