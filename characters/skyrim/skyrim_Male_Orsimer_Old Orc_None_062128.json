    "bio": "While traveling in the wilds, the Dragonborn may come across an Orc who stands near the corpses of two sabre cats. When spoken to, he says he is waiting for a \"good death.\"\r\nAll attempts to talk him out of it fail, and will be met with him saying that he has become too old to be a chief, too old to marry, and wants to die while he can still call himself a proper man, and that he wants to die in battle to please his god, the Daedric Prince Malacath.\r\nHe can be \"helped\" or left alone. Agreeing to help will cause him to become hostile. There are no rewards for \"helping\" him, so if you choose to leave him alone nothing will change except he will stay in the same spot until you \"help\" him.",
