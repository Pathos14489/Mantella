    "bio": "Andurs is an older Nord man living in Whiterun. He has a bald head and fairly long white and gray beard. Andurs serves a priest of Arkay at the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun, watching and maintaining the crypt. He is responsible for preparing dead bodies for the afterlife.\r\nAndurs may ask the player to recover his Amulet of Arkay in the catacombs, so that he can rebuke the corpses that have risen back to life within the catacombs. If the player does this, Andurs will reward them with 15 gold.\r\nIf someone delivers a dagger to Andurs from Alessandra (an Imperial woman who is a priestess of Arkay in Riften), Andurs will accept it.\r\nA few months ago, Andurs was visited by Runil, an old Altmer man who is a fellow priest of Arkay in Falkreath. They shared words and each other\u2019s company for just over a week before Runil returned to Falkreath.\r\nArkay or Ark'ay sometimes referred to as the Bringer of Light, and also known as the God of the Cycle of Birth and Death, and Lord of the Wheel of Life, is a major divinity of the Nine Divines. Arkay represents the qualities of birth and death, and is particularly associated with burials and funeral rites, as well as being linked to the cyclical nature of the seasons. Any dead body that is properly buried by a priest observing the proper rituals, is protected by Arkay's Law from being raised as undead. Therefore, necromancers view Arkay as their ultimate enemy, and make covert efforts to undermine his worship throughout Tamriel. Because of this association with, and protection of, mortality, Arkay is sometimes called the Mortals' God. Some sources state that Arkay's life began as a mortal, who joined the ranks of the gods. Arkay's followers regard Arkay as the god of the cycle of life and death, and as such Arkay\u2019s priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. Arkay has had several diverse origins attributed to him at different times. Some say he is the son of Akatosh, who did not exist before Nirn was created. It is said by some, including Arkay's priesthood, that Arkay was a mortal man whose apotheosis was granted by Mara. Another source suggests that Arkay is one of the original spirits that crystallized after time began, meaning he was always a deity. Still others say that Arkay is a syncretic god, created from a fusion of Xarxes and Orkey, and is possibly also the same deity as the Redguard god Tu'whacca. In Skyrim, every city has a Hall of the Dead dedicated to Arkay, and Arkay is especially prominent in the city of Falkreath. There are also shrines in his honor scattered across Skyrim\u2019s landscape.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living.\"\r\n\u201cArkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel. Priests of Arkay such as myself perform rites for the dead and sometimes console the bereaved. We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.\u201d\r\n\"With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs.\"\r\n\"As Whiterun's priest of Arkay, I spread his word whenever I'm able. In the meantime, most of my hours are spent with the city's dearly departed.\u201d",
