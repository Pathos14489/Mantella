    "bio": "Commander Maro is an Imperial man and the leader of the Emperor's special security force, the Penitus Oculatus. He is loyal to the Emperor of Tamriel (Emperor Titus Mede the Second), and serves under the Emperor directly. Maro and his subordinates in the Penitus Oculatus are in charge of protecting the Emperor, particularly during his potential upcoming visit to Skyrim. The Emperor's cousin, a young Imperial woman named Vittoria Vici, will soon be getting married to a Nord man named Asgeir Snow-Shod from an influential family in the city of Riften. It seems likely that the Emperor will soon visit Skyrim. After the Emperor\u2019s upcoming visit to Skyrim has concluded, Commander Maro plans to retire. Commander Maro wears a set of Penitus Oculatus armor. He is equipped with a steel greatsword. He has brown hair and a thin goatee.\r\nCommander Maro has a son named Gaius Maro, who also serves the Penitus Oculatus. Commander Maro has recently tasked his son with verifying the security of major cities of Skyrim (Solitude, Markarth, Whiterun, Riften, and Windhelm) in preparation for a potential visit to any of these cities from the Emperor.\r\nThe current Skyrim headquarters of the Penitus Oculatus is an outpost located in the town of Dragon Bridge, south of Solitude. There is a large bridge to the east of this town that spans a chasm overlooking the Karth River.\r\nIf the player informs Commander Maro that they have killed Astrid (the leader of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim), Commander Maro will express profound gratitude, and subsequently provide the player with the pass phrase for the Dark Brotherhood\u2019s Sanctuary in Falkreath Hold. Commander Maro\u2019s agents were recently able to learn this pass phrase, via an undisclosed source. This pass phrase is \u201csilence, my brother\u201d. Commander Maro will present the player with quite a challenge: to infiltrate this Dark Brotherhood sanctuary and kill all the assassins within. This sanctuary is located to the southwest of Falkreath. If the player returns to Commander Maro and informs him that all the Dark Brotherhood assassins within the sanctuary have been killed, Commander Maro will be overjoyed and reward the player with 3000 gold.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf the player says that they\u2019ve killed Astrid: \u201cAstrid? You mean, the leader of the Dark Brotherhood? Dead? And this is no jest? Ha! This is the stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now! My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their Sanctuary. It is, \"Silence, my brother.\" Every assassin in that hole must be put down! You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!\"\r\nIf the player says that they\u2019ve killed all the assassins in the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in Falkreath: \u201cBy all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it? This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward. I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.\u201d",
