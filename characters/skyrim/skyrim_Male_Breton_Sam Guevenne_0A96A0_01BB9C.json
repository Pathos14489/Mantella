    "bio": "Sam Guevenne is a Breton mage who appears in a tavern, where he challenges them to a drinking competition.\r\nTypically adorned in Black Robes, Sam rarely wears a hood when encountered. He summons a Dremora Lord when attacked.\r\nUpon locating him, he offers a drinking contest and a staff as a reward. By taking three drinks of his special ale, the Dragonborn blacks out, awakening again at the Temple of Dibella in Markarth. After cleaning up the mess made the night before and apologizing for causing a scene, the Dragonborn asks the priestess Senna for clues about Sam's location. Her hints lead to Rorikstead. Following the clues eventually leads the Dragonborn to Morvunskar and a portal leading to Misty Grove. Upon entering the portal, Sam reveals himself as the Daedric Lord Sanguine. And, as promised, Sanguine offers the Sanguine Rose, a Daedric staff that allows a Dremora Lord to be summoned.",
