    "bio": "Nocturnal is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the night and darkness. She is also known as \"the Night Mistress\" and \"Lady Luck\". The summoning date of Nocturnal is the 3rd of Hearthfire.\r\nNocturnal and Azura have been referred to as sisters. Nocturnal is sometimes referred to as Ur-Dra, referencing her claim as part of the original Void. She is thought to be the eldest and most powerful of the Daedric Princes. The Khajiit know her as Noctra, who can bring shadows and luck when called upon.\r\nPhysical descriptions of Nocturnal are difficult to come by, as she is usually described as being hidden by darkness and shadow. Depictions of the Daedric Prince usually take the form of a nondescript human woman, draped in a hooded cloak that hides most of her features and body. She is depicted with both arms outstretched, and a pair of Nightingales (or similar bird) perched on each wrist.\r\n\r\nNocturnal is an aspect of the void of Oblivion itself, and takes such titles as \"Mother of Night\" and \"Night Mistress\". Her very nature is such that humans cannot understand her, as she is the embodiment of the unfathomable and enigmatic. Worshipers of Nocturnal consist primarily of those who operate in darkness and night, such as thieves and spies. However, Nocturnal's deception is not usually meant to be harmful or violent in the manner of Boethiah. Rather, the unknowable nature of Nocturnal is the core of her being, and serves no real ulterior purposes beyond being mysterious. Thus, while thieves may consider Nocturnal their patron, assassins will typically lean towards a more violent deity, such as Molag Bal or Mephala.\r\n\r\nThe Nightingale Karliah describes Nocturnal as a scolding mother who pushes her child to do better. Nocturnal appears to care about mortals, unlike some other Daedric Princes.\r\n\r\nAlthough Nocturnal has arguably one of the largest followings of all the Daedric Princes, she has no form of organized clergy. There are a few who call themselves priests of Nocturnal, though the Night Mistress does not herself seem to show them any particular favor. Indeed, Nocturnal seems to have no real interest in worship. A temple of Nocturnal called the Twilight Sepulcher is located in Skyrim. The Twilight Sepulcher was built around the Ebonmere, the portal to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion known as Evergloam. Nocturnal is the source of a thief's luck, which flows from the Ebonmere and plays a heavy role in the lives of any who use the shadows to do their work.\r\n\r\nThough Nocturnal has no truly organized clergy, she has three mortal servants upon Nirn who are known as the Nightingales. The Nightingales serve Nocturnal directly, granted the power over shadow, subterfuge and strife in exchange for their service. Once a Nightingale enters into their contract with Nocturnal, they are bound for life and beyond to serve the Night Mistress in guarding the Twilight Sepulcher and in Nocturnal's realm Evergloam until Nocturnal feels the Nightingale's contract with her has been fulfilled.\r\nThere are several powerful Daedric artifacts associated with Nocturnal.\r\nThe Bow of Shadows was forged by Nocturnal and grants its wielder increased speed and invisibility.\r\nThe Eye of Nocturnal is an artifact through which Nocturnal can see into the world of Nirn. The Eye was stolen from Nocturnal during the Oblivion Crisis, and was later retrieved by her champion.\r\nThe most famous artifact of Nocturnal is the enchanted cowl she created. This headpiece possessed the ability to completely hide its wearer's identity from mortal knowledge, including magical forms of scrying and identification. The cowl's power was so great that people would be incapable of even remembering the name of whomever possessed the cowl, even while the cowl was not being worn. No one would be able to retain any long term memory of interacting with the cowl's wearer, and even removing the cowl in plain sight of others would not break its spell.\r\n The bearer of the cowl is known only as \"the Gray Fox\". This cowl has been stolen from Nocturnal by mortals several times in history. The first of these incidents recounted in an old tale called the \"Song of Hrormir\".\r\nThe Skeleton Key is another of Nocturnal's powerful artifacts, and is capable of opening any lock. In additional to physical barriers, the Skeleton Key can also unlock metaphysical barriers and untapped human potential. The Skeleton Key might very well be the most powerful, if underestimated, Daedric artifact in existence. This artifact travels between heroes and locations, and it is never be the property of one thief for too long. Frey's relatively recent theft of the Skeleton Key from the Twilight Sepulcher's inner sanctum is the reason for the hard times that have fallen on the Thieves Guild, since the Ebonmere, the gate to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion, has been kept open by the Skeleton Key, allowing luck to grace the actions of thieves throughout Nirn.",
