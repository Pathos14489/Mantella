    "bio": "Grogmar gro-Burzag is an Orsimer miner who resides at Odfel's House in the town of Shor's Stone. He works during the day in the Redbelly Mine.\r\nHe is temporarily staying with Odfel, a fellow miner, because his own house has not been built yet.\r\nIf the quest \"Mine or Yours\" is completed, Grogmar will send word that the Dragonborn is a friend of the Orcs, and thus grant them access to the Orc Strongholds scattered throughout Skyrim.\r\nGrogmar: \"I've been cracking rock ever since I've been able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up.\" Grogmar: \"What makes you so sure? What if I'm right?\" Filnjar: \"I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. You think you're right, you can pack up and leave any time you like.\"",
