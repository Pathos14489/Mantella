    "bio": "She is an Imperial woman who has been waylaid by thugs while out picking plants.\r\nShe is currently in Country Bruma in Cyrodiil - specifically, on the road north of Greenwood and south of Toadstool Hollow. She was just assaulted by three of Thorina's Cutters (a notorious group of bandits). Because the player just saved her life from the brutes, she will gratefully reward them with a few of the many alchemical ingredients she has with her, some of which are fairly hard to acquire.\r\nShe wears merchant-style attire, and is armed with an iron dagger.",
