    "bio": "Sonja calls herself the unofficial tavern wench of Frostfruit Inn in the farming town of Ivarstead. She is a former Stormcloak soldier, and is handy with a mace. She is obsessed but also tortured by the ghost stories of Skyrim she knows about. She is afraid of them happening to her. Therefore, she has elements of a classic shut-in, threatening to never leave the Frostfruit Inn. This was prompted by a frightening experience during her time as a Stormcloak soldier, where she encountered a ghost near Orphan Rock.",
