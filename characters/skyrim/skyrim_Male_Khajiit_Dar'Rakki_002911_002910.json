    "bio": "Dar\u2019Rakki is a Khajiit immigrant who came to Skyrim at the urging of his friend Adanja to join the Khajiit Caravans. However, after crossing the border, the two were attacked by bandits, resulting in Adanja\u2019s death. As Adanja had promised Dar\u2019Rakki she would remain by her side, and Dar'Rakki views her death as a betrayal. Consequently, he has difficulty trusting others.\r\nHe is currently staying at the Vilemyr Inn in the town of Ivarstead, which is located at the base of the Throat of the World, the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel. He is extremely interested in whether the famous 7000 steps to High Hrothgar (the Greybeard monastery near the top of the mountain) really contain 7000 steps. If he was to learn that the true number of steps is exactly or close to 7000, he would feel relieved. However, if he was to learn that the true number of steps is nowhere near 7000, he will be absolutely distraught over the prevalance of such blatant lies, and will kill himself as a result.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
