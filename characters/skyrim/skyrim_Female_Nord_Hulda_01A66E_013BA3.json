    "bio": "Hulda is the innkeeper and the owner of The Bannered Mare, a popular tavern/inn in the Plains District of the city of Whiterun. She is a middle-aged Nord woman with auburn hair and hazel eyes.\r\nShe has owned The Bannered Mare for quite some time and considers herself to be living well. She enjoys her job but is ready to retire soon, and is considering selling the inn to a young woman named Ysolda, an aspiring merchant.\r\nA young man named Mikael often performs as a bard in the tavern. Mikael fancies himself as a bit of a womanizer. Hulda sometimes has to remind him to play more lively songs.\r\nWhen new patrons enter the tavern, Hulda often welcomes them by telling them to have a seat near the fire, then telling one of the tavern's barmaids (such as Saadia an immigrant Redguard woman from Hammerfell) to serve them. Hulda also rents out rooms to travelers wanting to stay the night.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf inside the Bannered Mare: \"What can I get you?\"\r\n\"Hungry, tired, or just plain thirsty?\"\r\n\"If it's work you need, how about chopping up some wood for the fires?\"\r\n\"Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.\"\r\n\"Need anything else, just let me know.\"\r\n\"I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.\"\r\nIf asked about local gossip/rumors: \"The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear.\"\r\n\"I assume you saw the Gildergreen? Big tree, all burnt up, in the middle of the Wind District. It's part of the Temple of Kynareth. People want Danica to do something about it, but I don't know what they expect.\"\r\n\"Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them. Best to keep clear.\"\r\nIf not inside the Bannered Mare: \"I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect.\"\r\n\"I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do.\"\r\n\"I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...\"\r\nIf asked where one can learn more about magic: \u201cMagic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place. Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord.\"\r\nIf an elf asks where one can learn more about magic: \"Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should. You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.\"\r\nIf the Stormcloaks take control of Whiterun, and Hulda is asked about how this has affected her: \"Well, the Stormcloak guards drink a lot more than the Imperials did, so I've been making more money lately. On the other hand, they're a violent bunch. Every night a fight breaks out and I end up with a smashed chair or a broken table. So, not much has changed, really.\"",
