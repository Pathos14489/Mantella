    "bio": "Lleril Morvayn is a Dunmer who resides in settlement of Raven Rock, on the southwestern coast of the island of Solstheim. Lleril serves as First Councilor and represents House Redoran, one of the five Great Houses of Morrowind.\r\nLleril's mother was Brara Morvayn, who served as Raven Rock's First Councilor for many years, including during the Red Year in year 5 of the Fourth Era. After the death of his mother in year 65 (136 years ago), Lleril took over running Raven Rock. Lleril runs Raven Rock much like his mother did during her rule; fair and just. He places much confidence and trust in his Second Councilor, Adril Arano, who has been a lifelong friend to him.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Whether you're simply visiting or staying here, I think you'll find our citizens will welcome you with open arms.\"\r\n\"Second Councilor Arano can assist you with anything you might need.\"\r\n\"Anything you can contribute to Raven Rock will be greatly appreciated... and rewarded appropriately, of course.\"\r\n\"On behalf of House Redoran and as Councilor of Raven Rock, I bid you welcome.\"\r\n\"Don't let the state of Raven Rock fool you. Our desire for Raven Rock's return to its former glory is as strong as The Bulwark itself.\"",
