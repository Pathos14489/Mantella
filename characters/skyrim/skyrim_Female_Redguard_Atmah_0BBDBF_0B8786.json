    "bio": "Atmah\u00a0is a deceased\u00a0Redguard woman whose body lies in Labyrinthian, an ancient Nord ruin in Skyrim.\r\nMany years ago, Atmah was a mage present at an expedition to Labyrinthian. This expedition was composed of Atmah and five other mage apprentices from the College of Winterhold. During her time at the College, Atmah was the favored student of the Arch-Mage. Atmah accidentally orchestrated the event that led to her death and the deaths of nearly everyone (except for a male Dunmer named Savos Aren) in the expedition. A psychic ghostly impression of Atmah dwelled within Labyrinthian after the event.",
