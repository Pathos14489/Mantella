This village is located near the northeastern tip of the island of Solstheim.\r\nNikulas has grown weary of the Skaal lifestyle, wishing to leave the Skaal village and go out into the world. There, he hopes to earn great glory, claim vast riches, and hunt the deadliest creatures, much to the disdain of his mother Edla.\r\nEdla may ask the player (who is the Dragonborn) to talk some sense into Nikulas about his dreams of becoming an adventurer.\r\n",
