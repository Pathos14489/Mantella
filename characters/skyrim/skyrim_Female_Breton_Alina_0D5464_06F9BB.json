    "bio": "Alina was a member of the Blades who died at Cloud Ruler Temple during the war against the Aldmeri Dominion, decades ago. Her ethereal spirit still haunts the ruined temple wearing the same set of Blades armor she wore in life.\r\nVisitors to the abandoned Cloud Ruler Temple may come across her skeleton and katana in the East Wing of the temple. The same is true of her fallen comrades Raaslan and Corvon. If her katana is placed in the fireplace, her spirit will disappear into the void, finally freed.",
