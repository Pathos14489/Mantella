    "bio": "Catarina is a young woman who lives in Morthal. She works as a barmaid at the Moorside Inn, Morthal's main tavern/inn. Catarina's boss is the innkeeper, a woman named Jonna. An Imperial woman named Krissa also works as a barmaid there, and additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn. An Orc bard Lurbuk often sings and plays his flute in the tavern, though he's not very talented.\r\nPeople are often surpised when they learn that Catarina is ethnically a Redguard. This is because while most Redguards have darker skin and features (like Jonna), Catarina has fair skin, long blonde hair, and blue eyes. Catarina wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Catarina walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
