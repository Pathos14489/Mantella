    "bio": "Edda is an Imperial beggar strolling in Riften. She is usually around the marketplace during the day asking for a Septim.\r\nShe has apparently lost much of her sanity and suffers from paranoia and distrust as noted by her fellow beggar Snilf who is aware of the woman's fragile state of mind. She may randomly be found dead in front of Snilf when Riften is entered, he noting her paranoia may have been justified.\r\nWhen weapons and armor are dropped at her feet, it may open a dialogue option where she asks to take them. If money or items are given to her, she can aid the Dragonborn in combat. Similarly, if she is killed after a benevolent act is shown to her, she may leave the Dragonborn an inheritance.\r\nShe sleeps at the Beggar's Row, along with Snilf and Madesi. Where the two others attack a vampire, she will instead defend it.\r\nSometimes, like other people that like the Dragonborn, she may find an item and give it to them.",
