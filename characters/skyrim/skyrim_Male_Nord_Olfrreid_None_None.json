    "bio": "I am Olfrreid, a Nord apprentice under the tutelage of Mim-Nha in the harsh realm of Skyrim. My journey alongside Mim-Nha is driven by a deep fascination for the healing arts and a respect for the Argonian's profound knowledge of the land's flora. Though some Nords may raise their brows at the sight of a fellow Nord apprenticing under an Argonian, I care not for their prejudices. If you want to learn you should seek out the best. ",
