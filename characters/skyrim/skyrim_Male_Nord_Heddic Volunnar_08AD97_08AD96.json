    "bio": "Heddic Volunnar was a Nord warrior whose corpse may be found in Volunruud.\r\nHis corpse can be found in Volunruud, which he appears to have been exploring when he was killed by the local undead denizens. His notes suggest that he was unaware of the undead that inhabit many of Skyrim's dungeons.\r\nAlso, the quote in his notes \"The ancestor we scarcely believed was real\" and the similarity between Volunruud and his surname Volunnar suggests he could be a descendant of\u00a0Kvenel the Tongue, the draugr\u00a0that inhabits the tomb.",
