    "bio": "Iona is a Nord housecarl in The Rift. She is appointed Housecarl of the Dragonborn when they become Thane of the Rift. She waits for the Dragonborn at Honeyside.\r\nIf the Dragonborn wears the Amulet of Mara, they can marry Iona. Like most spouses, she can be moved to another owned house. She is also a possible Blades Recruit.\r\nIona is eligible to be a steward for one of the Dragonborn's homes if she is approached near the property.\r\nShe is skilled in One-Handed, Heavy Armor and Block. It is also wise to give her a bow, as she is almost as skilled in Archery as in One-Handed.",
