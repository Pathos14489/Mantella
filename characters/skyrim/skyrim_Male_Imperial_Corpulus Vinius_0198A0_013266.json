    "bio": "Corpulus Vinius, an Imperial man, is the owner of the Winking Skeever, an inn and bar in Solitude. Corpulus has light brown hair and a mustache, and wears a set of barkeep clothes. From behind the bar at the inn, Corpulus rents out rooms, and sells food and drink to the inn's patrons. He has 2 children: a young man named Sorex, and his younger daughter Minette. Corpulus has a cousin named Faida who lives in Dragon Bridge, south of Solitude. Faida is the proprietor of the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge.\r\nDuring peaks in business, Corpulus will sometimes state that he would like to retire and let Sorex run the Skeever. However, Sorex doesn\u2019t usually seem particularly enthusiastic about running the inn. Minette often states that she wants to take charge of the Skeever instead of Sorex, but Corpulus isn\u2019t keen on letting a young lady run the bar (despite the fact that his female cousin Faida runs a tavern). Admittedly, Minette is quite a smart girl. Minette keeps a good track of their inventory, and is surprisingly knowledgeable regarding the optimal brands and vintages of mead to serve at different times.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend.\"\r\n\"Need anything, you just say the word.\"\r\nIf asked why the inn is called the Winking Skeever: \u201cWell, as it turns out, I had a pet skeever when I was a boy and he used to wink.\"\r\nIf asked where one can learn about magic: \"Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it. Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though.\"",
