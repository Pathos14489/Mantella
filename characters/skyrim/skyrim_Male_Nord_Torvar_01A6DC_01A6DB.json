    "bio": "Torvar is a Nord warrior, and a member of the Companions who resides within Jorrvaskr in Whiterun. He is one of the Companions' newer members.\r\nUpon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Torvar can be recruited as a follower and becomes a potential marriage candidate. He can be recruited into the Blades if the Dragonborn talks to Delphine while having him as a follower.\r\nTorvar is shown to be a drunk, as many of his comments are concerned with drink. He doesn't take well to the intensive training, and argues with Farkas about not being allowed to go out and fight. In a conversation between him and Athis, he states a preference for hammers and axes.\r\nAt first glance, he acts friendly towards the Dragonborn. But as one progresses within the Companions' ranks, he becomes more sour, and possibly even jealous.\r\nDuring the last part of Blood's Honor, Torvar can be found outside Jorrvaskr, on the steps outside the front door, standing over a dead Silver Hand member.\r\nTorvar can be enlisted as a follower after completing Glory of the Dead. However, he can be obtained earlier by dropping armor in front of him while he is walking. He then asks the Dragonborn if he can have the item. If the Dragonborn says \"Consider it yours.\", he becomes available after leaving the area and coming back.\r\nInterested in me, are you? \"I'd be a fool of turning down a chance at marrying you! I'm game if you're game.\"\r\nIf Torvar should die, the Dragonborn may receive an inheritance of around 200 gold from him.\r\nTorvar resists arrest along with the Dragonborn if the player gets into trouble in a Hold and fights the Hold Guards without question, an uncommon trait amongst the rest of the Companions.",
