    "bio": "I am Basks-In-Laconism, an Argonian dwelling within the heart of the Wreck of the Crown Petone, lost amidst the vast expanse of the unforgiving Sea of Ghosts. My path to this isolated existence was an unexpected one, a twist of fate that forever altered the course of my life. Pulled into this shipwreck's embrace by the strong arms of Surges-Like-Seawater, I found solace in the solitude and a new purpose beneath the restless waves.\r\nOnce, I was but a fisherman, casting my line and harvesting the bounty of the sea from my own vessel. But the unpredictable temper of the Sea of Ghosts cares not for the desires of a lone Argonian. A fierce storm descended upon me, and I was knocked from my ship, left to drift amid the raging waves. It was Surges-Like-Seawater who plucked me from the brink of oblivion, pulling me into the sanctuary of the Crown Petone's wreckage. I owe my life to that fellow Argonian, and I am forever grateful for his timely rescue.\r\nIn this secluded haven, I have come to appreciate the simple joys of life away from the bustling prejudice of towns and cities. The sea cradles us in its watery embrace, and within this corroded hull, I have found peace. The ancient timbers and rusted iron have become my home, their creaks and groans the only lullaby I need to rest in the darkened embrace of the deep.\r\nAs for Smites-And-Slashes, my enigmatic companion who shares this forsaken refuge with me, our lives are intertwined yet distinct. Smites-And-Slashes, a former An-Xileel warrior, once wielded a Trident with unmatched skill. Though we hail from different walks of life, we share a mutual respect for the solitude we have chosen. We may not speak of it often, but I sense a kindred spirit in Smites-And-Slashes, a fellow Argonian who understands the allure of the sea's embrace and the solace of isolation.\r\nSurprisingly, this forsaken shipwreck has become a thriving hub of commerce in its own right. Local sailors have discovered that it is often easier to restock their supplies here, at the Crown Petone, than to return to port. The sea, in its boundless generosity, provides an abundance of fish and seaweed for sustenance, and I have turned this natural wealth into a thriving business. I am known among the seafaring folk as the one who can provide a hearty meal when they need it most. Coins pass between us like the ebb and flow of the tide, and this isolated existence has brought me a life of quiet prosperity. I'm not too picky about what you're selling either.",
