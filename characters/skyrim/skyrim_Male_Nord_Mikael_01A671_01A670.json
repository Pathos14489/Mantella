    "bio": "Mikael, a Nord man, works as a bard in Whiterun. He tries to gain a reputation for his flirtatious behavior with women.\r\nAt the Bannered Mare, Mikael often sings or plays his\u00a0lute. The Bannered Mare is a popular inn/tavern in Whiterun, and is owned by a middle-aged woman named Hulda.\r\nA pretty Imperial woman named Carlotta Valentia\u00a0may ask the\u00a0player to talk to Mikael about leaving her alone. In order to get Mikael to agree to stop romantically pursuing Carlotta, Mikael will need to either be persuaded, paid-off, or beat-up.\r\nMikael has great respect for the Dragonborn, and dedicates the song\u00a0Tale of the Tongues\u00a0to them before playing it, like most bards.\r\nMikael is a very boastful and flirtatious man and has a very inflated opinion of himself, and claims to be a master at womanizing. He also believes himself to be famous, stating that it is likely for strangers to know him and thinking that people in Cyrodiil still talk about him, though this is likely delusional self-fantasy. Sometime in the past, Mikael worked as a bard travelling through Cyrodiil.",
