    "bio": "Ghorbash the Iron Hand, an Orc man, lives in Dushnikh Yal, and is the brother of Chief Burguk.\r\nBy default, he wears Steel Armor. Despite wearing heavy armor, his highest skills are in light armor usage and archery, and is slightly less skilled with one-handed weapons and a shield. His skills make him an effective archer. Any combination of a one-handed weapon and shield also suits him. Ghorbash is less effective with two-handed melee weapons. As an ex-legionnaire, Ghorbash refuses to equip Stormcloak Armor.\r\nGhorbash will not steal, nor will he attack innocent people.",
