    "bio": "Nythriel, an Altmer woman, is a gossip hound. She lives in the city of Solitude. She makes no apologies for her gossiping behavior. She makes a number of wild accusations regarding the locals in Solitude, most of which are based purely on speculation. She may ask the player if they have any spicy news or rumors to share with her. Nythriel can often be found in either the Blue Palace, or the Winking Skeever. The Winking Skeever is a popular tavern/inn in Solitude, run by an Imperial man named Corpulus Vinius. When at the Winking Skeever, Nythriel often speaks with some of its patrons. One of these patrons is a young Redguard woman from named Fironet. Fironet is from Hammerfell, and aspires to join the Bards College in Solitude. Another such patron is Veralene, a high-class Breton woman who used to be rich until she lost her estate in the dragon attack at Helgen. Veralene is now currently desperately seeking out a suitable (wealthy) marriage candidate.",
