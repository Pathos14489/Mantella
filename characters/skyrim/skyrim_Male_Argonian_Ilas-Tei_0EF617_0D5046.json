    "bio": "Ilas-Tei is a deceased Argonian apprentice mage from the College of Winterhold in Skyrim. He was one of the missing students that Phinis Gestor will tell the Dragonborn of. He died practicing a Calm spell on skeevers, evidently with little success. Two Scrolls of Calm and a Scroll of Fury can be found nearby. The Scroll of Fury is lying right next to him with the Scroll of Calm on a nearby crate.\r\nThe apprentice's corpse can be found at the Shrine of Talos: Ilas-Tei's Last Stand, along with his ring. However, since this is a broken quest, acquiring it ends the quest.",
