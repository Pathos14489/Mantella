She is the daughter of Daighre and can be found outside Left Hand Mine outside Markarth.\r\nWhen she has been adopted by the Dragonborn, her dog Torom, comes with her.\r\nShe has a dog named Torom. She is a funny character and often makes silly comments. She is fairly lonely being that she only has a pet dog to play with all day. She claims that Torom is the best dog in the Reach, though.\r\nDaighre: \"Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?\" Erith: \"But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions.\" Daighre: \"You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!\" Erith: \"Yes, ma'am.\"",
