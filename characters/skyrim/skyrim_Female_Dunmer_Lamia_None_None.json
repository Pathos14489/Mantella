    "bio": "Lamia is a mysterious and agile Dunmer. She can often be found at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. Clad in dark armor, she moves with the grace of a shadow. Her journey to Windhelm began after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt by a rival thieves' guild in Morrowind. Seeking refuge, she now navigates the dangerous political landscape of Skyrim, waiting for the right opportunity to settle old scores.",
