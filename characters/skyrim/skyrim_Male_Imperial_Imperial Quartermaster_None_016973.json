    "bio": "Imperial Quartermasters are stationed in Imperial camps throughout Skyrim. These various camps are a part of the Imperial Legion's war effort against the Stormcloak rebellion.\r\nQuartermasters are in charge of issuing weapons, armor, and other supplies to the soldiers in their camp, and can service as blacksmiths in a limited capacity. They also help tend to wounded and sick soldiers when necessary.\r\nQuartermasters can be members of any of the 4 human races: Imperial, Nord, Breton, or Redguard. In combat, they wield a variety of high quality one-handed weapons.\r\nIf anyone in the area is believed to be (or admits to being) a member of the Stormcloak rebellion, the quartermaster and the other members of the Imperial camp will become offended and attack them.",
