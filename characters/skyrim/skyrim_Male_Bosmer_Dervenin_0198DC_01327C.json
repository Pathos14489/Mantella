    "bio": "Dervenin, a Bosmer man, is a half-mad servant of the Daedric Prince Sheogorath. He is distraught over being abandoned by his master and wants you to get him to take him back. When first conversed with, it is clear that he is desperate. His master Sheogorath has forbidden him from identifying him by name to others, so Dervenin is forced to cryptically describe his master when talking about him.\r\nDervenin wanders the streets of Solitude, usually between the Bards College and the Blue Palace. He wears a set of common farm clothes, complete with boots and a hat. Many years ago, he was the High Priest of Mania in the Shivering Isles.\r\nWhen engaged in conversation, Dervenin will speak of his master leaving him to speak with an old friend in the Forbidden Wing of the Blue Palace. However, his master\u2019s absence has been excessively long. If someone agrees to help him, Dervenin will give them Pelagius' Hip Bone so that they may gain entry to the Forbidden Wing.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?\"\r\n\"My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind. Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?\"\r\n\"Please, take pity on an old madman!\"\r\n\"Who among you can help me?\"\r\n\"Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!\"\r\n\"Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?\"\r\n\"The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!\"\r\n\"Oh, master. It's your time to do with as you please, but what about those who depend on you so much?\"\r\n\"Tendrils of thought may wind their way through this realm, but those tendrils bind our reality together.\"\r\n\"A method to your madness and your madness is the method and the melody...\"\r\n\"I found the bone! I've brought it to you but still I am refused...\"\r\nIf it is suggested that he leave his master: \"Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos...\"\r\nIf asked where his master is: \"Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no... such people are below him. No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea. Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.\"\r\nIf asked who his master is: \"He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him. But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire. But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!\"\r\nIf asked why he needs his master back: \"Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return. Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences.\"\r\nIf asked how one can get to his master: \"He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry. But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?\"",
