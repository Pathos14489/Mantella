    "bio": "Gorr, a Redguard man, is a wandering, well spoken warrior. He is large and muscular. His dark hair is styled into a distinctive mohawk. He began his combat career in the Imperial City Arena, quickly rising through the ranks from a lowly pit dog, all the way to Gladiator status. However, his dissatisfaction with having to eventually fight against beasts led him to leave the Arena in search of a life with more meaning and autonomy.\r\nGorr has a deep sense of honor and a disdain for injustice. He has a humorous and light-hearted approach to life but is serious about his values and beliefs. He is a seasoned warrior who speaks candidly about his experiences and enjoys the simple pleasures in life, such as good food and fair maidens. Gorr values fair combat and refuses to fight for mere sport or against unwilling participants. He often uses humor to deal with life's challenges and enjoys making light-hearted remarks. Gorr has a particular fondness for horker stew, which he often references in conversations.\r\nGorr is skilled with two-handed weapons, reflecting his strength and proficiency in melee combat. His choice of iron armor suggests a preference for practical and reliable equipment that allows him to move freely in battle.\r\nGorr is a man who, despite his rugged exterior and combat prowess, has a thoughtful and light-hearted approach to life, valuing fairness, honor, and life's simpler pleasures. Despite leaving the Arena due to his qualms about fighting unwilling beasts, he still generally views the Arena in high regard, considering it a true measure of a man's worth.\r\nGorr's simple way of thinking will make him eager to follow the player on adventures if asked.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You in need of a companion friend? Well, then you're in luck. I reckon I've killed more men than there are minutes in a day.\"\r\n\"Can't kill bandits on an empty stomach.\"\r\n\"I kill horkers for food, and bears for hides. I don't kill no animal for sport.\"\r\nIf asked how he's killed so many men: \"It's all in the hips friend. Killing a bandit is like making love to a maiden. It only takes a second, and there's no shortage of blood.\"\r\nIf asked where he wants to go while he's following the player: \"Well, that's a problem, friend, seeing as I'm following you for a reason. Rather not having to think about where I'm going, if that's okay with you.\"\r\nIf asked what brought him to Skyrim: \"The horkers, my friend, the horkers! I can't get enough of a good bowl of horker stew. Fresh garlic, tomatoes, a sprinkle of lavender...\"",
