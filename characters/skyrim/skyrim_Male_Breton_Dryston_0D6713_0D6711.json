    "bio": "Dryston is a Breton Forsworn residing in The Warrens of Markarth.\r\nAfter Weylin's assassination attempt on Margret, an Imperial operative, the Dragonborn searched his room for evidence on a motive. Learning that Weylin was employed by a mysterious person named \"N,\" they exit the Warrens, only to be confronted by Dryston, who is angered by the Dragonborn's sleuth-work.\r\nTo learn the identity of \"N,\" the Dragonborn must win a brawl with him. Alternatively, one can pickpocket the note off of him or kill him during the ensuing fight; acquiring Dryston's Note will give the same information. Either way, the Dragonborn will learn that N is actually Nepos the Nose.\r\nIf the Dragonborn wins the brawl against him and does not kill him, he will reside in Weylin's room in the Warrens afterwards.\r\nDryston may appear as a radiant target for the Thieves Guild quest \"The Fishing Job.\"",
