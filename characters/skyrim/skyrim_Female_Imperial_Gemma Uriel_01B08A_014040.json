    "bio": "Gemma Uriel is an Imperial and the sister of Ganna Uriel located in Steamscorch Mine in Kynesgrove.\r\nShe came from Cyrodiil in hopes of finding a better life in Skyrim, but she can be heard complaining that coming here was a mistake. She and her sister traveled from Cyrodiil to start a lumber mill in Kynesgrove - a failure, as the surrounding trees turned out to be sacred to Kyne.\r\nIn order to pay the debts from the failed lumber project, Gemma reluctantly works the mine, and hacks away with her pickaxe every day between 8 AM and 5 PM. She eats two one-hour meals a day, at 7 AM and 5 PM, at the Braidwood Inn.\r\nLike most other residents of Kynesgrove, she sleeps in a tent in the neighboring camp, every night between 10 PM and 6 AM. At all other times she wanders around the camp or spends time at the inn.",
