    "bio": "Ainethach is a Breton man with dark brown hair, residing in the town of Karthwasten, of which he is the leader. He also owns the local Sanuarach Mine. Karthwasten is located in the Reach.\r\nAinethach has been arguing with Silver-Blood mercenaries (led by a Nord man named Atar) about Sanuarach Mine. The mercenaries want him to sell it to them in repayment for their help in clearing the Forsworn rebels who had captured it.\r\nThe player can choose to help Ainethach keep his mine, by either convincing Atar and his mercenaries to leave, or by simply killing the mercenaries so they are no longer an issue. It is also possible to convince Ainethach to sell his mine to the mercenaries.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If the Forsworn aren't attacking my town, the Nords are trying to force me off it.\"\r\n\u201cThe Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land. Forsworn attacked the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to \"help.\" They won't let anyone work until I sell it off.\"\r\n\u201cThe Silver-Bloods are a family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth. The Silver-Blood family owns half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it.\"\r\n\"My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord. Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.\"",
