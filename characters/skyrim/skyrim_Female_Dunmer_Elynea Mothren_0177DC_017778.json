    "bio": "Elynea Mothren is a Dunmer alchemist living on Solstheim. She runs the Tel Mithryn Apothecary and serves as Neloth's mycologist.\r\nAs a young girl, she recalls the eruption of Red Mountain. Her mother sent her on a boat to Skyrim, and it was the last she ever saw of her. As time passed, she began to study fungi and became a mycologist. She eventually settled in Tel Mithryn to further her studies and in her later years took on the responsibility to nurture and care for the giant mushroom towers.\r\nMost of the ingredients she sells are fungi and mushrooms, such as blisterwort, white cap, Namira's rot, although she sells other ingredients and potions as well.\r\nAcquire three taproots and soak them in the Headwaters of Harstrad to repair the withered Telvanni tower.\r\nI have the three soaked taproots. \"Truly? Well done. I'll just keep two of them for myself. No need for Neloth to know. Take that last taproot and plant it into the wall of the withered house.\"\r\nThe soaked taproot is planted. \"Good. Now maybe Neloth will get off my back about it. I suppose you think you should get paid for helping an old woman. Here. Take these. I'll sell you more if you come back later.\"\r\nHave you seen Varona? \"She left for Raven Rock hours ago. She promised to bring me back some fresh blisterwort.\"",
