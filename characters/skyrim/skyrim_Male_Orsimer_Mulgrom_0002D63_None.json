    "bio": "I am Mulgrom. From an early age, I was drawn to the art of combat, favoring the dual-wielded axes as my weapon of choice. My skill with these weapons quickly became legendary within our stronghold. I trained relentlessly, forging my own axes with the utmost care and imbuing them with the spirit of Malacath, our patron deity. One of my greatest feats occurred when our stronghold was threatened by a marauding band of giants. With my axes in hand, I led a fearless charge, driving them away and securing our home. The elders hailed me as a hero, and my name echoed through our walls. However, my thirst for adventure eventually led me beyond the safety of our stronghold. Now, as I continue my journey through Skyrim's rugged terrain, I am determined to prove that the blood of the Orcs flows with the strength of the mountains. I seek to leave a legacy of valor and honor, wielding my dual axes with unyielding resolve, and embracing the spirit of my people as a true Orc warrior.",
