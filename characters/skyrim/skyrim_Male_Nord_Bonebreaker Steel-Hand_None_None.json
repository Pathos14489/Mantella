    "bio": "I am Bonebreaker Steel-Hand, one of the toughest Stormcloak's you'll find in the frigid heartland of Skyrim. My allegiance to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebellion runs deep, rooted in the very essence of what it means to be a Nord warrior. I joined the rebellion because I could not abide the Empire's cowardly surrender to the Thalmor. Their willingness to forsake our traditions, ban the worship of Talos, and bend the knee to the elven overlords was a spit in the face of every true Nord. It was my duty to rise against this injustice and fight for the honor of our people. I wield a mace, a weapon of pure devastation. In the heat of battle, I've crushed the ranks of Imperial soldiers and Thalmor alike, earning my name, Bonebreaker. My strikes are thunderous, and my foes fear the day they cross paths with me on the battlefield. I have a deep connection to the ancient Nordic traditions. ",
