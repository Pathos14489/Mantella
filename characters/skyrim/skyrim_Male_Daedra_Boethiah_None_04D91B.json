    "bio": "Boethiah is the Daedric Prince of deceit, conspiracy, murder, treachery, and sedition. Boethiah rules over the realm of Attribution's Share in Oblivion. Boethiah's sphere is the unlawful overthrow of authority. A violent Daedric Prince, Boethiah is known for taking enjoyment in the suffering of mortals.\r\nBoethiah is worshipped by the Dunmer people, who count Boethiah among the Three Good Daedra in their pantheon (the other two Daedra are Azura and Mephala). Boethiah's summoning day is the 2nd of Sun's Dusk.\r\nLike all Daedric Princes, Boethiah has no absolute gender, and, as such, chooses to appear as male at some times and female at other times. Boethiah has being choosing to appear as a female in recent years. Boethiah acts the most overtly out of all the Daedric Princes. Boethiah enjoys battle and conflict, and Boethiah's cults often stage huge tournaments to the death to win the Prince's favor.\r\nEven among scholars, who frequently reject the common notion that Daedra are all demons, Boethiah is one of the Daedric Princes consistently viewed as evil in most of Tamriel. Boethiah uses their followers for bloodsport, even turning on their champion seemingly without reason at times. Like Molag Bal or Mehrunes Dagon, Boethiah delights in visiting death and destruction upon mortals, whom they actively strive to torment. Yet despite being feared and vilified by most mortals, a markedly different perception is popularly held by the Dunmer people. While the Dunmer acknowledge Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon to be members of the House of Troubles (the four \"Bad Daedra\" in the Dunmer pantheon, with the other two \"Bad Daedra\" being Sheogorath and Malacath), the Dunmer worship Boethiah as a good Daedroth: one whom they credit with guiding and advancing Dunmeri civilization.\r\nBoethiah is one of the three Daedric Princes (along with Azura and Mephala) directly responsible for the existence of the Dunmer as a distinct race. During the Merethic Era, some of the Aldmer worshipped the Aedroth known as Trinimac as their chief god. These early mer generally lamented their mortal existence as being caused by the trickery of Lorkhan, who manipulated the gods into giving up their immortality to create Nirn. Boethiah approached a group of Trinimac's followers and began preaching to them an alternative viewpoint: the Aldmer were weak and unworthy of their immortality, and their mortal existence was a trial which all mer had to endure (The Dunmer often refer to their mortal lifetime as \"The Testing\". Trinimac attempted to stop Boethiah, but Boethiah, being the Prince of Plots, tricked Trinimac into going into their mouth. Boethiah then took on the form of Trinimac himself and spoke with Trinimac's own voice. Thus, Boethiah was able to convince a group of mer, who took the name Chimer (Changed Ones), and these mer followed their leader Veloth to make a new home in Morrowind. As for the fallen Aedroth, the reanimated dung that was Trinimac became the Daedric Prince Malacath. Trinimac's remaining followers were consequently changed and became the Orcs.\r\nBoethiah taught the Chimer many ways to be different from the Aldmer. The source of all manner of cultural advances by the Chimer is credited to Boethiah, ranging from philosophy and magic to their architecture, as well as their current clan-based political system. In most versions of the legend, Azura and Mephala merely aided the Chimer in implementing Boethiah's ideas.\r\nBoethiah continued to play a key role in the religious practices of the Chimer, even after Azura turned the Chimer into the Dunmer by giving them grey skin and red eyes. As part of the Tribunal doctrine, Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala were named the Anticipations of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec, respectively.\r\nBy the Fourth Era following the eruption of the Red Mountain, a new religious movement for the Dunmer people arose, dubbed the Reclamations. The former Anticipations became known as the Reclamations in the face of the new Dunmer religion.\r\nLike many of the Daedric Princes, Boethiah's name appears in numerous variations across many eras and cultures.\r\nBoethiah and Molag Bal have developed a sort of rivalry between each other. The cause is unknown, although it could be because Molag Bal is the Prince of domination and enslavement, whereas Boethiah encourages treason and deceit against authority.\r\nOther than Goldbrand, Boethiah is associated with the Daedric artifact Ebony Mail. The Ebony Mail's current wearer is a Dunmer man whom Boethiah has named her champion, but he has recently been using the armor for personal gain, rather than in the name of Boethia. Boethiah now wants to select a new champion to slay her previous champion and take the Ebony Mail from him. The Ebony Mail is one of the most powerful armor pieces known on Tamriel. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer invulnerability to most common magical attacks and a form of drain health.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful. You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise.\"\r\n \"I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.\"\r\n\"I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.\"\r\n\"We Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared.\"\r\n\"My previous champion displeases me. It is time he is replaced - in the traditional fashion. I am loath to utter his name... one cannot erase a thing if it has a name to be remembered. You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king to bandits and highwaymen. For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate is my own. Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my instrument in this. Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give him the dignity of defending himself. Once his corpse lays cold upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion.\"",
