    "bio": "Mabrelle lives in Riverwood, where she works as a barmaid at the Sleeping Giant Inn. Her boss is Orgnar, a gruff Nord man who cooks and runs the tavern/inn. The inn is owned by an older Breton woman named Delphine, but she isn't around as often.\r\nRiverwood\u2019s main point of interest is its lumber mill. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills, stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west.\r\nMabrelle is a tall Nord woman with long auburn hair and blue eyes. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Mabrelle walks around the tavern serving drinks and food. An Imperial woman named Weyna also works there as a barmaid, and additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.\r\nFrequent patrons at the tavern include a man named Alvor (the town's blacksmith), Hod (who owns the town's lumber mill with his wife Gerdur), Camilla Valerius (a young Imperial woman immigrated from Cyrodiil with her older brother Lucan), and Embry (the town drunk).",
