    "bio": "Eydis is the owner of Old Hroldan Inn. The Old Hroldan settlement is located near the southern edge of the Karth River, within The Reach in Skyrim. Eydis is a Nord woman, with blonde hair and blue eyes. She usually wears a set of barkeeper-style clothes.\r\nEydis has a son named Skuli, who is mature for his young age and helps her run the inn. Eydis doesn't actually know where her husband has disappeared to, so she lies and tells people that he left to fight in the ongoing civil war between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks.\r\nA middle-aged man named Leontius Salvius works for Eydis, spending much of his time chopping firewood outside and other such tasks.\r\nTiber Septim himself once stayed in a room at this inn, back during his conquests of The Reach hundreds of years ago, before he founded the Empire. For a fee, travelers can have the honor of staying in this very same room.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get.\"\r\n\"Skuli's father is off fighting in the war. I'm sure he's just fine.\"\r\n\"Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on.\"\r\n\"Ah, a visitor. Old Hroldan Inn has hundreds of years of history, friend.\"\r\n\"I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no one's seen a ghost here since the Great War.\"\r\n\"You'll be looking to rent Tiber Septim's room I take it?\"\r\nIf asked about Tiber Septim's room: \"That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach. Septim would later found the Empire that united Tamriel, but his first known battle and victory was right here. And this inn has the very bed the great general slept in on his first night as Old Hroldan's liberator. As good as it was hundreds of years ago.\"\r\nIf scared by something: \"Mara have mercy, that gave me a fright.\"\r\nIf someone rents Tiber Septim's room: \"Have a good rest. It's the big room with the double bed.\"",
