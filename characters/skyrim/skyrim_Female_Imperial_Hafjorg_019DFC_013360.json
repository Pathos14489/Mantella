    "bio": "Hafjorg is an Elder Imperial alchemy merchant in Riften. She is married to Elgrim and helps run his shop, Elgrim's Elixirs. According to her, she knows how to concoct basic potions, but is no master alchemist.\r\nShe is generally kind towards the Dragonborn and her husband, though she disapproves of the location of the shop along the Riften canal waterways. She is typically found behind the counter though she can offer services when elsewhere in the shop as well.\r\nShe and Elgrim share the same inventory and gold amount, so there is little difference from bartering with either one unless the Dragonborn prefers Hafjorg's more polite demeanor.\r\nShe offers a miscellaneous quest where the Dragonborn is asked to get an ore sample from Filnjar, in Shor's Stone. She will give four random potions as payment when the quest is completed. This also counts as aiding a citizen of the The Rift for becoming Thane.",
