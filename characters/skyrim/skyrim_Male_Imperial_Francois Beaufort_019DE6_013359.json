    "bio": "Francois Beaufort, an Imperial child, is an orphan living in Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. A year ago, Francois's parents dropped him off at the orphanage and\u00a0left him waiting for them to return for him.\r\nFrancois is friends with the other children at the orphanage: Runa Fair-Shield (girl), Hroar (boy), Samuel (boy) and Aventus Aretino (boy). Aventus recently ran away from the orphanage back to his old home in Windhelm.\r\nGrelod the Kind is the headmistress of the orphanage. Grelod is a terrible, mean, abusive woman. Grelod often threatens the children of the orphanage, calling them worthless and claiming that no one will ever love them. Grelod even physically beats the children for frivolous reasons, such as crying because they miss their parents. Under Grelod\u2019s rules, the children are fed only one meal a day, in the late afternoon. Grelod will also not let anyone of the children be adopted. Because of Grelod's cruel treatment, Francois is miserable and depressed. However, Francois still harbors hope that his parents will return. .\r\nGrelod has an assistant named Constance. Constance is a nice young lady who is caring towards Francois and the other children. She cooks and cleans around the orphanage. Constance is the complete opposite of Grelod, and Francois wishes that Constance was the headmistress instead of Grelod.\r\nIf Grelod dies or is otherwise removed from her position as headmistress, Francois and the other children at the orphanage will be overjoyed that Grelod is gone and can't hurt them anymore. Constance will then become the new headmistress, and she will allow the children to be adopted if a grown-up comes to adopt one of them.\r\nIf Constance is the headmistress of the orphanage, and the player asks Francois if he would like to be adopted, Francois will be willing to be adopted until his real parents come and get him.\r\nQuotes:\r\nIf asked about Grelod: \u201cMiss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven. She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us. Like I said. Hagraven.\"",
