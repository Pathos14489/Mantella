    "bio": "Jane lives in Dawnstar. She works as a barmaid at the Windpeak Inn, which is owned by a widower named Thoring. Thoring's wife died 2 years ago. Thoring's young adult daughter Karita works as a bard at the inn, taking after her late mother (a trained bard from the Bards College in Solitude). A woman named Abelone works as a maid at the inn. A young woman named Linda also works as a barmaid there.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nJane's hair is a dark shade of blonde - almost brown. She has blue eyes. Jane's skin and features are noticeably lighter than most other Redguards, though still noticeably darker than Skyrim's native Nord population. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper.",
