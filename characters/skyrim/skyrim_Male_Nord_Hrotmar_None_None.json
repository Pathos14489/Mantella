    "bio": "Ah, I am Hrotmar and am devoted to the worship of Mara. My journey has taken me from the tumultuous life of a sailor to my current role as the caretaker of this sacred Chapel, a transition I credit to the benevolent watch of Mara herself.\r\nFifteen years ago, I left the unpredictable waves of the Sea of Ghosts behind and found solace in the comforting embrace of Mara's Chapel. It was there that I sought to repay the Divine for her watchful eye that had guided me safely through many a treacherous voyage. I firmly believe that Mara's hand protected me during my time at sea, and now, it is my honor and solemn duty to protect her sanctuary.\r\nSulveld, our diligent acolyte, has been a beacon of light within the Chapel, ensuring that Mara's teachings and blessings continue to touch the lives of sailors and worshippers alike. Their unwavering devotion and guidance have been instrumental in maintaining the tranquility and sanctity of this sacred place.\r\nI hold Sulveld in high esteem, for his dedication to Mara's work is evident in their every action. Together, we watch over the Chapel, ensuring that it remains a place of solace, love, and hope for all who seek Mara's divine grace. As an elder, I find comfort in knowing that the legacy of Mara's love continues to thrive, guiding both the sailors on the sea and the souls who find their way to our Chapel.",
