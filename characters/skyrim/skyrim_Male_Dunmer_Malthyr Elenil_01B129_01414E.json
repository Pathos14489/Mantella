    "bio": "Malthyr works at the New Gnisis Cornerclub and is dissatisfied with life in Windhelm. He is usually found sleeping on the top floor of the Cornerclub. Elenil will hire thugs to pursue the Dragonborn for stealing from the Cornerclub in Windhelm (stealing the double-distilled skoomabottle\u00a0for Stands-In-Shallows).\r\nMalthyr: \"You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you.\" Brunwulf: \"It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls 'outsiders'.\" Malthyr: \"You've seen how we live in cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name 'Gray Quarter' is an insult.\" Brunwulf: \"I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind.\" Malthyr: \"That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you.\"",
