    "bio": "Nepos the Nose is an Elder Reachman and a citizen of Markarth in Skyrim who has ties to the Silver-Blood Family interests in Cidhna Mine.\r\nNepos' dialogue gives insight about the events of the Markarth Incident, including the claims made in The Bear of Markarth.\r\nNepos, alongside with Thonar Silver-Blood, is the primary antagonist of the quest. He is located in his house and is found reading a book by the fire. His servants, Tynan, Morven, and Uaile appear to be very caring and protective of him, but are actually Forsworn Agents, tasked with watching over him. Uaile greets the Dragonborn at the entrance, and tells them Nepos is busy and should not be disturbed. Nepos' dialogue reveals that he is a Forsworn who answers to Madanach, the King in Rags. He further tells of how Madanach works from the Cidhna Mine, a Nordic prison, directing the downtrodden citizens to kill in the name of the Forsworn. He appears to be unaware of the deal Madanach struck with the Silver-Bloods and believes he is furthering the Forsworn cause. After exiting the dialogue with Nepos, the Dragonborn will be attacked by Nepos, Uaile, Tynan and Morven.\r\nIf \"The Forsworn Conspiracy\" quest is not active, continuing is considered trespassing and the guards will be called.\r\n\"Ah, yes. You've proven to be a real bloodhound. Well, you've sniffed me out. I've been playing this game for almost 20 years. Sending the young to their deaths. All in the name of the Forsworn. And I'm tired. So tired.\"",
