    "bio": "Traillus lives in the small town of Heljarchen. He is a blacksmith, and his forge and smithy are attached to his house.\r\nHeljarchen is a small town next to a small lake, located within the Pale hold of Skyrim. Rocky hills and pine trees surround this town and lake, except on the north side. The much larger Lake Yogrim to the southeast, which is frozen over for much of the year, is fairly close to Heljarchen. There is a major road (which runs east-west) just north of the town, and people traveling along this road often stay the night in Heljarchen at Nightgate Inn. North of this road, the tall and wide Winterhold mountain range looms over the town and the surrounding areas.\r\nHeigen is a Nord man with reddish-brown hair and a thin beard. His house is at the southeast corner of town, up against the rocky hills. Unlike most of the houses in town, his house has a basement. On a night, Traillus can often be found having a drink at Nightgate Inn, which is managed by an older man named Hadring.",
