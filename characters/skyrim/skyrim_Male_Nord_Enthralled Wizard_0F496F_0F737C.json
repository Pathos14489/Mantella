    "bio": "He is the ghost of a deceased Nord man named Hafnar\u00a0Ice-Fist. Hafnar was an apprentice mage at the College of Winterhold.\r\nHe and the ghost of Atmah (a Redguard woman and fellow College student) are the last \"survivors\" of Savos Aren's ill-fated expedition into Labyrinthian. During this journey, all but two of Savos Aren's companions perished. Savos Aren, a Dunmer man, is also one of the six mage apprentices who embarked on the ill-fated Labyrinthian expedition. Labyrinthian is an ancient Nordic ruin.\r\nMany years ago, Hafnar, Atmah, and Savos reached the room where the Dragon Priest Morokei resided. Hafnar and Atmah were then slain. Savos, the sole actual survivor of the expedition, enthralled his fallen friends' spirits so that they might imprison Morokei within an energy shield to keep him from escaping.\r\nThe Enthralled Wizards reside in the last room of Labyrinthian, keeping Morokei trapped. In order to kill Morokei and recover the Staff of Magnus, one will need distract or kill the ghosts of Hafnar and Atmah so that they no longer contain Morokei.",
