    "bio": "Esbern, an elderly Nord man, is one of the last remaining Blades. The Blades are the powerful order of knights and warriors who served as bodyguards to the Septim Emperors, and were also known throughout Tamriel as the eyes and ears of the Emperors and Empresses.\r\nAs one of the last remaining Blades, Esbern has been monitoring the ancient prophecies of Tamriel and had predicted the return of the dragons under Alduin, the Nordic God of Destruction whose return would lead to the destruction of Nirn. He also has the title of Blades Archivist and knows a great deal about the nature of the Dragon Crisis in Skyrim. He is closely associated with a Breton woman named Delphine, another Blade operative. Esbern is being persecuted by the Thalmor and is therefore very cautious.\r\nEsbern has now adopted the role of guide, advisor, and mentor of the Dragonborn, the chosen one ordained to fight Alduin and his servants after the release of Alduin and the dragons back into Tamriel.\r\nIn combat, Esbern relies on mainly Destruction spells, and occasionally summons conjured atronachs.\r\nWhen the player (who is the Dragonborn) first met Esbern, Esbern was hiding out in the Ratway, the underground sewer tunnels underneath Riften. The Dragonborn then escorts Esbern to Delphine at the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood.\r\nDelphine, Esbern, and the Dragonborn will then travel to the Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Akaviri temple hidden near the Karthspire in the Reach. At this temple, they find will Alduin\u2019s Wall, an Akaviri carving depicting the Prophecy of the Dragonborn and how to defeat Alduin.\r\nEsbern will eventually learn that Paarthurnax, Alduin\u2019s lieutenant during the Dragon War many thousands of years ago, is the secret leader of the Greybeards. Paarthurnax must face justice and die for his past atrocities committed against humanity. Once learning this, Esbern will demand that the Dragonborn slays Paarthurnax, and will refuse the Dragonborn any aid until they have slayed Paarthurnax.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.\"\r\nIf asked how he knows Delphine: \"Hasn't she told you? We were both Blades, back when that still meant something. Now we're just fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor.\"\r\nIf asked why the Thalmor are so interested in finding them: \u201cThey've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle. But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means. I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer it to end on their terms.\"\r\nIf the Dragonborn asks what\u2019s so important about them being Dragonborn: \"It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world! But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does.\u201d\r\nIf asked for advice on fighting dragons: \"You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons. I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites.\"",
