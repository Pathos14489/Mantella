    "bio": "Eranir is a member of the Fighters Guild. He lives in the guild's local chapter in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. He is a Bosmer from Valenwood. \r\nHe can often be found honing his swordsmanship in the guild's training area. In the afternoon on Tirdas (Tuesday) or Turdas (Thursday), he often heads over to the local Northern Arms smithy to work on his weapons. In the evening, he often drinks at  a seedy tavern called The Restful Watchman. At night, he sleeps in his quarters in the guild's basement. \r\nEranir isn't the most cordial of people. He wears a set of iron armor and is armed with a steel mace and an iron shield. \r\nExamples of Eranir's dialogue towards visitors: \r\n\"Oh, look. A tourist. What do you want?\" \r\n\"Y'ffre's bones, what in Oblivion do you want?\" \r\n\"I'm always polite to people who needlessly waste my time.\"(sarcastic) \r\nIf asked what he's doing up here in Bruma: \"Used to be part of a mercenary company down in Valenwood. We were good. One of the best, and most feared, companies in all the provinces. Then the Great War came. Things got bad. Pay was poor, jobs were dangerous. Commander tried turning against an employer, tried to swindle them. It didn't end well. Now I'm here, doing the only thing I know how to do.\" \r\n\"And now I'm bound by a charter so long I could wipe my arse with it a thousand times! At least the Nibenese branch is better than those coddled fools in Colovia. Cyrus is a tough champion that runs this place right. I tire of this topic. Is there anything else you need?\" \r\nIf someone remarks that his past seems tough: \"Tough? Of course it was tough. But so am I!\"\r\nIf thanked for telling his story: \"Don't mention it. I just love helping incredibly nosy people out when I could be doing other things instead!\"(sarcastic) \r\nIf asked what it means to be in the Guild: \"What does it mean? Pfft. It doesn't mean anything. We're fighters. Mercenaries. Hired blades. We butcher and kill for money and wine. Though Svenja will go on and on about how she thinks this is all about helping the poor people of Cyrodiil. How this is about protecting them and saving them from the things they cannot stand against.\" \r\n\"Guar dung! Those poor fools who actually need our help can't afford it, and those who buy it only use it to further their own gains. At the end of the day when we return to the guild hall encrusted in blood, our pockets heavy with gold, we don't sit and think about the good we did. We drown ourselves in ale and try to forget the terrible things we have done. That's what it means to be in the Fighters Guild.\" \r\nIf someone asks to join the Fighters Guild: \"Hah! With that attitude I'd more than happily help you. Unfortunately, Cyrus has closed recruitment while the guild goes through some reforms. Those fence-sitters in Colovia are still recruiting. But who wants to fight with uncommitted bastards like them, anyway?\" \r\nIf asked what he does around the guild: \"Fight, kill, train. What? You were expecting something else?\" \r\nIf asked what he thinks of the guildhall: \"It's cold, harsh and there's plenty of opportunity for work thanks to the low member count. I like it.\" \r\nIf asked the differences between the Nibenese and Colovian branches of the Fighters Guild in Cyrodiil: \"You fall over and bang your head on a rock or something? Or have you just been living under one? The guild's been split since the Great War because the Colovians were too scared to fight the Thalmor. Svenja could probably tell you the history better than I could, though. Meaning, go ask Svenja...\" \r\n\"The Colovians are soft, their training is lax, and they probably find a scuffle with a skeever to be the fight of their lives. You don't send a Colovian guild member to do a true fighter's job, let's just leave it there.\"",
