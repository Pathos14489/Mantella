The Necromancer bound Ashtoreth to a book and kept this book to himself for hundreds of years, as the Necromancer became a lich himself. Eventually The Necromancer was betrayed by his own coven of (other) Necromancers and the book has since passed down Necromancer to Necromancer and they have all abused Ashtoreth's power for their own greed.",
