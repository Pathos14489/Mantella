    "bio": "Rilja Stone-Hearth lives in the city of Bruma, in Cyrodiil. She works as a pawnbroker, with a stall in the Bruma market. She specializes in ancient Nordic artifacts. \r\nRilja is a relatively young Nord woman with brown shoulder-length hair. She typically wears Colovian fur clothes and a pair of fine boots. She often carries her unique sharpened one-handed Nordic war axe on her belt. She lives in a shack in the slums outside the city walls. Compared to the other shacks in the slums, her dwelling is much better kept and furnished, with banners, furs and Nordic decorations adorning the walls. \r\nHer merchant stall in the marketplace is located in between the Chapel of Saint Martin and the Jerall View Inn. She often has dinner and drinks at the Jerall View after work. This tavern/inn is run by Stantus Faleria and his wife Hjotra, assisted by waitresses such as Lassinia Iron-Heart. \r\nRilja takes great pride in her Nordic heritage. She is friendly and often converses with her customers, such as an elderly Nord man named Ralgar Silver-Plow.\r\nHere is an example of a potential verbal exchange between Rilja and Ralgar:\r\nRalgar: \"Wife sent me. She said you had some amulet or other?\"\r\nRilja: \"I have several, actually. One supposedly worn by the Felldir the Old, another crafted in the fires of the Skyforge. Which one did Felki want?\"\r\nRalgar: \"Eh, I have no bloody clue... just give me them both. I'll pay.\"\r\nRilja: \"You spoil her rotten, you know that?\"\r\nRalgar: \"Yes, I do. Thanks.\"\r\nHere are some examples of Rilja's dialogue towards strangers:\r\n\"I'm proud of my ancestry, as should all Nords be.\"\r\n\"Trade's been slow, what with all the trouble up north.\"\r\nWhen she is at her market stall: \"Here to browse my fine selection of ancient Nordic items?\"\r\nIf she is asked about her collection: \"Many of them I collected during my adventuring days. I used to wander Skyrim in search of opportunity and adventure. I went through my fair share of Nordic ruins back in those days, and I took a liking to the ancient Nordic metalwork. So, I began to collect them as I adventured, and when I finally decided to settle down, I had quite an extensive stock.\"\r\nIf she is asked why she's selling some of her collection: \"Why not? It's not something you see up for sale very often, and I think there are plenty of Nords here in Bruma who'd like a little memento of their history.\"\r\nIf asked how business is going:  \"It's going well. A lot of travelers tend to buy from me, as well as young Nords who are soul-searching, trying to find their Nordic heritage here, in Cyrodiil.\"\r\nIf she is asked why she is in Cyrodiil: \"The same reason I sell ancient Nordic artifacts: so that the young Nords here in Bruma can be reminded of their roots. Bruma has all the surface trappings of Skyrim: the snow, the cold... But Skyrim is so much more than that, something Bruma isn't and can never be. It's about the Nordic ruins dotting the landscape, about the dragon walls. It's about the diversity: Whiterun and The Reach, The Pale and Eastmarch. That variation of Nordic culture is something Cyrodiil doesn't have. I'll be content if my presence here reminds just a few Nords that they're not just Imperials with more facial hair and deeper voices.\"",
