    "bio": "Knjakr is an insane Elder\u00a0Nord\u00a0cannibal\u00a0who can be found hidden away in the Ratway Warrens deep beneath Riften.\r\nWhen the Dragonborn first approaches Knjakr's room, he will call them to come in. If they enter, Knjakr will become hostile and attack, saying \"I am going to eat well tonight, my darling!,\" which indicates him being a cannibal or becoming one due to the lack of food. He wears a Chef's Tunic and Chef's Hat that suggests he was a chef before moving to the Warrens.",
