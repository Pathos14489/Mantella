    "bio": "Agnis is an old Nord woman living inside Fort Greymoor who cooks and cleans for the occupants, which are either Legionnaires, Stormcloaks, or bandits, depending on the state of the Skyrim Civil War. Fort Greymoor is located to the west of the city of Whiterun, on the open plains of Whiterun Hold.\r\nAgnis is not hostile to anyone. She will never leave the fort, and has been the maid for all the different factions and groups who have inhabited it over the past decades. They come and go so fast, and she doesn't care. She tells any new group claiming the fort that she comes with the fort. If anyone drops an item in the fort, she will retrieve it and return it to them.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I really must get back to my duties. This fort isn't going to clean itself.\"",
