    "bio": "Niels was a Nord bandit in\u00a0Falkreath Hold. His corpse lies in Moss Mother Cavern, after he was killed by a spriggan.\r\nHe ventured to the cave with Ari and Valdr to kill a bear they were hunting. The three were attacked, Ari and Niels killed by spriggan attacks, which left Valdr wounded and helpless outside of the cave.\r\nIf Moss Mother Cavern is visited after the events of \"Hunter and Hunted,\" there are two small cairns outside the cave entrance. These likely represent where Ari and Niels are buried.\r\nValdr requires assistance at avenging the death of his friends, Ari and Niels. To do this, they must kill the spriggans taking up the cavern.",
