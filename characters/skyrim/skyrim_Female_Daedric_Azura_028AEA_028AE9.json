    "bio": "Azura is the Daedric Prince of Dusk and Dawn, the magic between Day and Night. She is also given titles such as \"Mother of the Rose\" and \"Queen of the Night Sky\". Her sphere of influence is the period of transition and change, as seen in the constant twilight of Moonshadow, Azura's realm of Oblivion. Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy. Azura's Star, a Daedric artifact associated with Azura, can trap souls and functions as a rechargeable soul gem.\r\nAzura is known to be one of the more merciful and benevolent Daedric Princes, though her wrath is swift and painful when brought about. She oversees the Daedric Realm of Moonshadow, a beautiful world of blurred colors streaming together, cities of silver, and air like perfume. The ones who visit this realm are mostly of either the Dunmer of Morrowind or the Khajiit of Elsweyr, as both revere Azura (though in different ways).\r\nAzura is sisters with Nocturnal, the Daedric Prince of the night, darkness, and luck. Despite this, Azura and Nocturnal are enemies.\r\nAzura's summoning day is the 21st of First Seed. On this day of the year, all Dunmer priests summon Azura for her guidance and support. This holiday is known as Hogithum, and is revered by the Dunmer people.\r\nAzura may have harbored a hatred for the Dwemer race before they gained access to the Heart of Lorkhan and vanished from existence, due to an event in which Azura was tricked by a Dwemer into revealing that she is not as omniscient as she appears.\r\nAzura helped teach the Chimer people how to be different from the Altmer, whom they branched off from. Azura has always been considered one of the three \"Good Daedra\" in Morrowind, along with Boethiah and Mephala. Thousands of years ago in the First Era, prior to the apotheosis of the Tribunal (Sotha Sil, Almalexia, and Vivec), Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala were the primary focus of worship for the Chimer people in Morrowind.\r\nAfter Indoril Nerevar successfully led the Chimer to defeat the Dwemer at Red Mountain on the large island of Vvardenfell, he summoned Azura to ask her what to do with Kagrenac's tools (Sunder, Wraithguard, and Keening). After the disappearance of the Dwemer race via Dwemer Chief Tonal Architect Kagrenac's use of these tools to interact with the Heart of Lorkhan, Azura instructed Nerevar and his subordinates never to use the tools to tap into the Heart's power for themselves. However, Dagoth Ur, Sotha Sil, Almalexia, and Vivec disobeyed and used the Heart's power to become like gods, killing Nerevar in order to tap into the Heart of Lorkhan's divine power unopposed. As punishment, Azura cursed the golden-skinned Chimer to permanently become the ash-skinned, red-eyed Dunmer. Azura then prophesied that one day, Nerevar's reincarnation would end the Tribunals' godhood.\r\nThousands of years later, during the Third Era, Emperor Uriel Septim VII released an unknown prisoner to Vvardenfell, believing that the prisoner may be the Nerevarine (the reincarnation of Nerevar). Azura covertly blessed this prisoner and guided them along the way to their destiny. After being named as Nerevarine by the four Ashlander tribes and as Hortator by three of the Great Houses of Morrowind, and with Vivec's help, the Nerevarine destroyed Dagoth Ur and House Dagoth, who planned to use the Heart of Lorkhan to animate the giant Dwemer golem Akulakhan and wreak havoc on Tamriel. In the process, the Nerevarine freed the Heart of Lorkhan from its enchantments via striking it with Sunder and Keening, thus severing the Tribunal from their source of godhood and making them merely powerful mortals. Thus Azura's Nerevarine prophecy was finally fulfilled.\r\nNow in the Fourth Era, following the eruption of Red Mountain, a new religious movement among the Dunmer people has arisen. This new doctrine declares the downfall of Tribunal-worship and the rise of their previously named Anticipations as the proper beings for worship. These Reclamations are Azura, Mephala, and Boethiah, reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\r\nAzura is also worshipped heavily by the Khajiit people - her name is spelled \"Azurah\" in Khajiit mythology. According to their legends, Azurah was one of the many children of Fadomai, and the only of her children who did not abandon her as she neared death. Fadomai gave Azurah three secrets as a reward for her loyalty, telling her to choose one of the children of Nirni, the mortal races, and change them and name them Khajiit. The Khajiit were given the three gifts: to be the most beautiful, clever, and fastest creatures in the world; to be the best climbers in the world, and to be the best deceivers in the world.\r\nAzurah waited as Nirni gave birth, and as Lorkhaj created a place for them to live. Nirni saw many of her children die and many fled to the stars, and of the rest, Nirni was most sad for the forest people (the Bosmer), whom she felt had not found their place. Azurah came forth and changed some of the Bosmer into the various forms of the Khajiit, and bound their birth and growth to the moons, Masser and Secunda.\r\nThere is a massive shrine to Azura in Skyrim, in the mountains south of Winterhold. A group of Dunmer refugees built this shrine in Azura's honor after she warned some of them about Red Mountain's impending eruption, allowing them to evacuate in time. This shrine is currently watched over by a Dunmer named Aranea Ienith, the only priestess of Azura in Skyrim.\r\nSometime after Aranea became a priestess, Azura's Star was stolen by a Dunmer named Malyn Varen - a necromancer who wished to exploit the artifact in order to preserve his soul immortally within. The player may agree to seek the Star and recover it. They may then choose either to take it to an Altmer named Nelacar (he will turn the star black and corrupt it), or to bring the star back to Azura, who will purge it of Varen's spirit and cleanse it. If the player returns and helps purge Azura's Star of Malyn Varen's presence, Azura will dub them her champion.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen. But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you.\"\r\n\"Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of your fate in the Twilight.\"\r\n\"Oblivion has been watching you since the day you were conceived, mortal. Do not think that your life has been served by your will alone. Go now. I have seen the threads of your fate in the Twilight, and you still have much to accomplish.\"",
