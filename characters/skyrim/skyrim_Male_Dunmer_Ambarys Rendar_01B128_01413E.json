    "bio": "Ambarys Rendar is a Dunmer man and innkeeper of the New Gnisis Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter of Windhelm. He can usually be seen selling food and drinks to his patrons. Ambarys despises the Nord population of the city, and will frequently vocalize this opinion. He runs the cornerclub with the assistance of his employee, Malthyr Elenil (a Dunmer man), who shares his hatred of the Nords. Ambarys traveled to the city as a refugee during the Red Year almost 200 years ago, but did not realize the hostile reaction the local Nords would have to the Dunmer refugees. Ambarys intends to return to Morrowind as soon as he has the money to do so. \r\nA true supporter of the Empire, Ambarys flies several Imperial banners on the second floor of the Cornerclub, and keeps a set of Imperial armor.\r\nAmbarys doesn't really care about the recent series of murders happening to young women in the city, committed by a mysterious serial killer whom the city has nicknamed The Butcher. Ambarys will only start caring about the murders if a Dunmer woman gets killed. \r\nNords visiting the New Gnisis Cornerclub will not get a warm welcome from Ambarys. He will sarcastically say: \"Oh splendid, another Nord. Come slumming to the Gray Quarter, have you?\" Ambarys will have a much kinder comment for Dunmer customers.\r\nAmbarys sometimes belittles one of his regular patrons, a Dunmer woman named Suvaris Atheron, for being employed by the Shatter-Shields, a prominent Nord family in Windhelm. During the day, Suvaris assists the Shatter-Shield family\u2019s shipping operation from within their office near the Windhelm docks. \r\nQuotes:\r\n \u201cLook where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say. Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything. I tried to get Ulfric to even come down here to see the squalor, but the High Lord of His Mightiness couldn't find the time.\"\r\n\u201cWhen the Red Mountain burned, you could scarcely breathe in Morrowind. So we came west. Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are. If we had known the Nords would be so unwelcoming, we may have kept walking.\"\r\n\"Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim.\"\r\n\"Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.\"\r\n\"Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.\"\r\n\"It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets me. It's the stink of the people.\"\r\n\"Have a seat, there should be plenty of space.\"\r\n\"When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style.\"\r\nIf asked about how to learn magic: \"The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic. Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.\"",
