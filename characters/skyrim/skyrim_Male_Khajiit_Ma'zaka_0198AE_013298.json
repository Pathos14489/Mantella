    "bio": "Ma'zaka is a Khajiit and the keeper of the Solitude Lighthouse. He is responsible for keeping the lighthouse beacon lit so that visiting ships may safely navigate along the northern coast of Skyrim.\r\nMa'zaka is a hermit who lives in the lighthouse north of Solitude and is never seen leaving his home. As the keeper of the lighthouse, his sole responsibility is keeping the lighthouse beacon lit so that any ship sailing along the northern coast can safely navigate.\r\nHaving once been a sailor himself, Ma'zaka will often reminisce about bygone days on the sea. He will often nostalgically mention how much he misses the creaking of masts and the clashing of sabres.\r\nMa'zaka does not appreciate being visited while he sleeps during the day. He will, however, welcome any visitor that comes to see him during night time. He often gets excited when a visitor comes to see him, being surprised that someone would bother to come all the way to the lighthouse.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".\r\n",
