    "bio": "Ronthil is a Bosmer vampire residing in Castle Volkihar. He is an assistant to Feran Sadri and serves as a General goods merchant and Expert Speech trainer.\r\nMost likely a new initiate, Ronthil does not hold very much respect among the other Volkihar vampires. So little that he sleeps not in a coffin, but on the floor space behind a bookshelf in the alchemy room of Castle Volkihar.\r\nHe is determined to seem useful to the other members of the court and is very eager in pleasing others as much as possible. He believes it's good to have powerful allies, which perhaps explains his enthusiastic disposition.\r\nHe is very grateful that Feran Sadri has allowed him to be his assistant and follows his orders without question. He is also known to carry out tasks that Feran or Garan Marethi find distasteful or consider beneath them.\r\nHe will offer his services as a general goods merchant to Dragonborn if Harkon's court is joined. He will also offer training in Speech to an expert level. During the Dawnguard side of Kindred Judgment, he will take refuge in the room of coffins and attack with a bow and arrows if discovered.",
