    "bio": "Anders is a deceased Nord man whose dead body lies inside the Twilight Sepulcher, a cave at the base of the Jerall Mountains that functions as a sort of shrine to Nocturnal, the Daedric Prince of darkness and luck.\r\nAnders and Nystrom posed as priests of Nocturnal to obtain the Sepulcher's treasure. According to Nystrom's notes of Lythelus' riddles, this treasure is found inside Pilgrim's Path. Anders subsequently murdered Nystrom and left his body inside the first room of the Twilight Sepulcher, so that he would not have to share the treasure.\r\nAs part of the last riddle, Anders jumped down into a pit, but found himself trapped at the bottom and eventually starved to death.\r\nAnders' wrote a note before he died, which reads as follows: \"I can't believe it. I came all this way, solved all of those ridiculous riddles just to end up here! After I memorized Nystrom's clues he'd collected from Lythelus, I slit his throat. Now I guess the joke's on me, because I'm stuck here and I don't see a way out. Hope someone comes by soon, I'm getting hungry.\"",
