    "bio": "Alhildr Fair-Wind lives in Dawnstar with her wife Merrienne. Alhildr is a Nord woman with X eyes and X hair. She usually wears X. Her Nordic accent is noticeable, but not particularly strong.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nAlhildr and her wife Merrienne are both middle-aged, though they both have relatively youthful voices that make them sound younger than they really are. She met Merrienne (a Breton) in Northpoint, High Rock. Alhildr was a sailor, now retired, and they have a home in Dawnstar near the Windpeak Inn.\r\nQuotes:\r\n",
