    "bio": "Alexia Vici is an old Imperial noblewoman visiting Skyrim. She is the mother of Vittoria Vici and the aunt of the Emperor Titus Mede the Second. Alexia's snow-white hair is slightly longer than shoulder-length.\r\nAlexia Vici disapproves of Nords, especially Stormcloaks, and thinks of them as uncivilized beasts.\r\nAlexia is attending the wedding of her daughter Vittoria. She expresses her disapproval of her daughter's groom, Asgeir Snow-Shod, because he is a Nord. She also complains about the Emperor not attending the wedding, despite being the cousin of the bride. She can also be seen arguing with Vulwulf Snow-Shod (the father of the groom) about the Skyrim Civil War.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cThose trouble-making Stormcloaks refuse to submit to Imperial authority. Such seditious behavior. Why it's treason!\"",
