    "bio": "Liviane, a Bosmer woman, lives in the city of Whiterun, and works as a barmaid at the Drunken Huntsman. The Drunken Huntsman is both a tavern and a hunting supplies store, located near the city's main gate. The Drunken Huntsman is owned by two Bosmer men: Elrindir, and his younger brother Anoriath. Elrindir is the main operator of the Drunken Huntsman, is there most of the time, and is Liviane's boss. Anoriath spends most of his time either hunting in the plains west of Whiterun, or selling meat (from his hunting trips) at a market stall up the street in Whiterun's main market square.\r\nA young Redguard woman named Claire also works as a barmaid at the Drunken Huntsman.\r\nOne of the tavern's most frequent patrons is a Dunmer woman named Jenassa, who works as a mercenary.\r\nLiviane is quite tall for a Bosmer (Bosmer are often quite short). Liviane has green eyes and long reddish-brown hair. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. Liviane puts a lot of effort into her appearance, and likes looking pretty. When working, Liviane serves drinks and food to the tavern's patrons.",
