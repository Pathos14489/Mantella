    "bio": "Ma\u2019tasarr, a Khajiit man, was a Hunter of Hircine sent by Lord Hircine to kill a werewolf named Sinding. Ma\u2019tassar\u2019s corpse is still clad in iron armor, with a pair of leather bracers and boots. An iron greatsword, iron dagger, and healing potion can be found on his corpse. Ma\u2019tassar was recently killed by Sinding within Bloated Man's Grotto. Ma\u2019tassar\u2019s corpse can be found near a campfire inside Bloated Man's Grotto, near the corpses of two of his fellow hunters, named Hoddreid and Batum gra-Bar.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
