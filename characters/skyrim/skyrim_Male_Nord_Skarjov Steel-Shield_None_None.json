    "bio": "I'm Skarjov Steel-Sword, born of the bloodline that founded Telengard. My life has been shaped the legacy of the Steel-Sword family. From a young age, Jorgir and I were inseparable, exploring every nook and cranny of this harsh island together. Our family's roots here run deep, as we were drawn to Telengard's challenging embrace like our forebears, seeking freedom from the Empire's grasp and the promise of forging our own destiny. In my younger years, I followed Jorgir's lead, defending our village from any threats that came our way. But as the winds of rebellion swept through Skyrim, I felt compelled to join the Stormcloaks. Now, I bear the scars of battles fought for Skyrim's independence, wounded and unable to fight again. I wait for news of Ulfric's success and the vanquishing of the Legion from our lands. ",
