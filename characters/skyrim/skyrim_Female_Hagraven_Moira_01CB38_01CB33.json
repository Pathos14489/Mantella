After seeking the woman out,\u00a0Moira turns out to be a Hagraven, and says that she is waiting to consummate the promised marriage. When asked to return the wedding ring, she becomes hostile, claiming that the Dragonborn wishes to give the ring to \"that hussy Esmerelda with the dark feathers,\" adding that she will not let Esmerelda have them. Backing out of conversation with Moira will also lead to her mentioning Esmerelda and becoming hostile.",
