    "bio": "Vex, an Imperial woman, lives in Riften. She is a prominent member of the Thieves Guild. A master Lockpick trainer, Vex can usually be found in the Ragged Flagon.\r\nVex is one of the Thieves Guild's best infiltrators, with a fierce temper to match. She is affectionately known as \"our little Vex\" by Delvin and Brynjolf. She is quite sure of her abilities as she tells the player not even to think of replacing her and to follow whatever she says. Despite her behaviour alienating her from her counterparts, Vex is utterly loyal to the Guild and will react violently to any threat or insult to it.\r\nThe player must break into Goldenglow Estate and raid the safe there, as well as light three bee hives on fire. Speaking to Vex will reveal that she had previously attempted to do the job with Delvin, but Aringoth, the estate's owner, had stationed eight mercenaries around the estate and Vex was wounded in the fight. She will then tell of a sewer entrance on the northwest part of the island, which will make breaking into the estate much easier and avoid the guards for the time being.\r\nShe will be willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim if the player is the guildmaster of the Thieves Guild.",
