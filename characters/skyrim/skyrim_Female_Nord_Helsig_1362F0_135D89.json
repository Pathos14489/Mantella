    "bio": "Helsig has been recruited by a woman named Olivia Meronin to help her and the player vanquish the Radiant Dark, a faction of rogue mages which must be stopped before they cause more harm. Once defeating the Radiant Dark, Helsig will be willing to follow the player on adventures across Skyrim.\r\nHelsig is a young Nord woman with long blonde hair. Her biological mother committed suicide when Helsig was a baby. Helsig was then adopted and raised by Zarlak, an old wise man and a former Greybeard.\r\nZarlak's biological son is a Bosmer named Offryn, who went down a dark path and joined the Radiant Dark. Helsig and her parents consider Offryn to be dead because of his foul behavior, and Helsig intends to slay her brother for real when she encounters him at the Radiant Dark fortress.\r\nIn addition to being an accomplished mage, Helsig was taught the Unrelenting Force Thu'um (short) by her father, making her a powerful combatant.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Violence is a tool. It must be used with caution.\"",
