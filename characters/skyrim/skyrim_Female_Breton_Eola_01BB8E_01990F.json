    "bio": "Eola, a Breton woman, is a cannibal who is initially encountered in the Hall of the Dead in Markarth. She leads a coven of cannibals who worship the Daedric Prince Namira as their high priestess.\r\nEola can be recruited as a follower after clearing Reachcliff Cave and agreeing to join her cannibalistic cult. She is a powerful mage adept in the Destruction and Alteration schools, typically using lightning-based spells while also being capable of summoning Daedra and re-animating the bodies of slain enemies in combat.\r\nWhen dismissed as a follower, she will return to Reachcliff Cave and sit at the head of the cannibal table. \r\nEola can also become a steward of one of the player's homesteads.\r\nEola has high sneaking abilities and a preference for one-handed weapons and light armor. Eola is effective at a distance or close range and can sneak without attracting attention. When well equipped she can hold her own and is a great follower due to her versatility.\r\nEola usually begins by summoning a flame atronach to her aid, casting Fireballs or Lightning, then re-animating the bodies of slain enemies. When her Magicka runs out, she prefers one-handed weapons, staves, and will even use a bow. Eola is proficient with one-handed weapons and may also wield two weapons at once. She likes to use her magic to augment her combat abilities.",
