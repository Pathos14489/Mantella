    "bio": "Holgeir was a warlord in the forests of Skyrim before the dragons returned.\r\nHe met Fjori, a huntress, when she was 29 years old. The two battled, falling in love when Fjori broke his axe with her sword, and he dulled her sword with his shield. Shortly after, Holgeir was bitten by a venomous snake.\r\nFjori obtained an elixir from the Akaviri and saved Holgeir's life. Her love fully-restored, she too was bitten by the same snake after the elixir was used up, falling dead. Holgeir built a tomb for her, killing himself after its completion.\r\nHolgeir appears as a draugr, summoned by Lu'ah Al-Skaven, a Redguard necromancer in Ansilvund. She intended for Holgeir's body to serve as the vessel for her deceased husband, Saeel.\r\nBased on the player's level, he spawns as a leveled draugr, or even possibly a Dragon Priest. After Lu'ah is defeated, Holgeir appears alongside Fjori as a ghost, and awards the Ghostblade to the Dragonborn for freeing them.",

It's a Skyrim-ified version of the MaleAltmer_Bosmer_Dunmer_GSaint voice model from Oblivion. It's not a perfect match, but it's the same VA: Craig Sechler"
