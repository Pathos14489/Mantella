    "bio": "Lurbuk is an Orsimer\u00a0bard and can be found in Moorside Inn, in the city of Morthal.\r\nA graduate of the prestigious Bards College in Solitude,\u00a0Lurbuk has quite the reputation in Skyrim: he is widely acknowledged as the absolute\u00a0worst bard in all of Tamriel.\r\nThe innkeeper is also not a fan of Lurbuk, but allows him to continue playing because \"business is so slow.\"\r\nHis daily schedule involves playing at the inn during the day and periodically taking breaks. He also sleeps at the inn.\r\nIt seems that due to his terrible reputation as a bard, several parties have requested for him to be assassinated. In fact, Nazir claims that Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine whose request would be honored.\r\nIf Lurbuk has not been killed, he'll be one of the men assigned by the Jarl to assist in killing the master vampire.",
