    "bio": "Camaron is an archaeological researcher studying the mysterious and abrupt disappearance of the Dwemer thousands of years ago, and the possible connection of their disappearance to the proplyon chambers once used by the Dunmer in Morrowind. Camaron is a Redguard. While not personally proficient at combat, she is able to explore various Dwemer ruins thanks to the prowess of her bodyguard, a male Argonian named Scotti, who wears a full set of Dwemer/Dwarven armor.\r\nCamaron is looking for a Dwemer relic called the Lexicon; along with a Dwemer device called an Attunement Sphere, the Lexicon is the key to a revolutionary discovery relating to the ancient Dwemer and teleportation machines. Her primary rival is her former mentor: a female Bosmer named Aldi. Aldi is searching for the same artifacts Camaron is.\r\nHere is some examples of Camaron's dialogue towards Aldi:\r\n\"I don't need your help! I'm tired of our colleagues saying I rode your coattails!\"\r\n\"So you came...just as I predicted you would. I told Scotti only a true ignoramus would come to Mzinchaleft after I made it clear it was another ruse. Yet you do serve a purpose. When we reintroduce ourselves to the Dwemer, they will wonder why it took so long for us to find them. And I need only point them to exhibit A: the lump of orichalcum you call a brain!\"\r\n\"No, this is my discovery! I don't need your fake Lexicon! I- I already found the real one, in some ruin you haven't heard of!\"\r\n\"We'll see who's bluffing when I take both the lexicon and the sphere to Alftand. Come Scotti. We have Dwemer to find.\"\r\n\"(Sigh) Maybe you're right. I suppose it would be just as unsavory to steal the Lexicon as it would be to share the credit.\"\r\n\"Fine. We can work together, but on one condition. I want to be the first to use the chamber. It's only fair, given I found it.\"",
