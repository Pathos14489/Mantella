    "bio": "Kirginne lives in Solitude, the provincial capital city of Skyrim. She works as one of the barmaids at the Winking Skeever, a popular inn/tavern. Kirginne's boss (the owner of the Winking Skeever) is an Imperial man named Corpulus Vinius. Corpulus is assisted in running the inn by his young adult son Sorex and capable younger daughter Minette. Rina (a Breton), Miraette (an Imperial), and Suleen (an Altmer) are Kirginne's barmaid co-workers at the tavern. Bards from Solitude's Bards College (such as a cheerful woman named Lisette) often play music at the tavern.\r\nKirginne is a Nord woman with long dark brown hair and blue eyes. She typically wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Kirginne walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
