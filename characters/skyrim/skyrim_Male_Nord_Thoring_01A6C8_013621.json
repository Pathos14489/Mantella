    "bio": "Thoring, a Nord man, is the owner and innkeeper of the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar.  He rents rooms, has food and some food ingredients for sale, and, like most innkeepers and bartenders, is a good source of rumors concerning local happenings as well as bounties being offered by the Jarl. \r\nHis daughter Karita is a young woman who works as the inn's bard. Thoring\u2019s wife died 2 years ago. Karita often talks with Thoring about wanting him to find another woman to be with, in order to help cure Thoring\u2019s grief. Thoring is often talking with Karita, about how she has her mother's voice. Thoring's wife was a bard who was trained at the Bards College in Solitude.\r\nRustleif (a Nord man) and his wife Seren (a Redguard woman) are blacksmiths who live relatively close to the Windpeak Inn. Rustleif and Seren recently announced that Seren is pregnant with their first child.",
