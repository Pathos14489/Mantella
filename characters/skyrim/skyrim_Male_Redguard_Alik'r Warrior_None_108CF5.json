    "bio": "Alik'r Warrior is a member of the Alik'r people. The Alik'r are Redguard, scimitar-wielding natives of the northern part of Hammerfell. They are named after the Alik'r Desert, which is the largest desert in Tamriel.\r\nLed by Kematu, the Alik'r coterie recently arrived in Whiterun, searching for a Redguard woman accused of treason. According to Kematu, they have been hired by the noble houses of Taneth (a major port city in southern Hammerfell) to track down a Redguard noblewoman who sold out the city to the Aldmeri Dominion, causing the fall of Taneth to the invading Aldmeri Dominion armies. The traitor's name is Iman, but she is almost certainly using an alias in order to evade detection.\r\nThe Alik'r and Kematu will hide in Swindler's Den, a cave across the plains west of the city of Whiterun. Sometimes Alikr' Warriors are encountered in the throughout other parts of Skyrim, confronting various Redguard women and trying to determine whether or not they are the traitor they have been looking for..\r\nThis Alik'r warrior wears standard Alik'r warrior garb including an Alik'r hood, and carries a scimitar.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information.\"\r\nIf asked about whom they are trying to find: \"A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us. She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location. We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything.\"",
