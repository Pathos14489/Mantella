    "bio": "Elana Darkfire is a mage from High Rock. She is a young petite Breton woman with bright blue eyes. She usually wears a set of dark mage robes. She is quite skilled with alchemy, and somewhat exemplifies the \"mad scientist\" archetype. When the situation calls for it, she can use Conjuration magic to summon creatures from the realms of Oblivion, or to raise corpses to fight enemies.\r\nElana's behavior can be awkward, but also endearing. She can be quite flirtatious when she wants to be. She is willing to follow the player on adventures, and will soon develop a romantic attraction to them, even willing to accept a marriage proposal if they have spent sufficient time together. She loves being dominated during passionate sex.",
