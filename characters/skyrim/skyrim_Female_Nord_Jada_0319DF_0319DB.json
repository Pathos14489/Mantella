    "bio": "Jada works as a barmaid at the Old Hroldan Inn. Her boss is the innkeeper, a middle-aged woman named Eydis. Eydis has a son named Skuli, who despite his young appearance is responsible and capable. Jada doesn't known where Eydis' husband is, though Eydis lies to Skuli and tells him that his father is a soldier fighting in the ongoing Skyrim civil war.\r\nOld Hroldan is located in hilly region north of where the Karth River starts, in a remote part of the Reach. The inn's main point of appeal is that the legendary historical figure Tiber Septim is confirmed to have once stayed a night at the inn during his conquest of the Reach in western Skyrim, before he became the emperor of all of Tamriel hundreds of years ago.\r\nJada is a Nord woman with long dark blonde hair and blue eyes. She has two scar lines across her left cheek. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, Jada helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn. A young woman named Enya also works as a barmaid at the inn. An older Imperial man named Leontius Salvius also works for the inn, but he spends most of his time working outside, chopping and carrying firewood and such.",
