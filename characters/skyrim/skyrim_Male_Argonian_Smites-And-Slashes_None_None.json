    "bio": "Smites-And-Slashes, a name earned in the muck and mayhem of times long past, is but a humble Argonian now residing amidst the chilling solitude of the Wreck of the Crown Petone, nestled in the unforgiving embrace of the Sea of Ghosts, hist-touched and water-bound. I chose this life, for it grants me the precious gift of solitude, a choice few dare to make in this bustling world of ours. A lone wanderer I may be, yet the companionship of five other Argonians lingers nearby, should I ever seek their company: Basks-In-Laconism, Can-Not-Even, Chomps-On-Hail, Surges-Like-Seawater, and the mysterious Albino One. These are the names etched into my memory, friends when the desire for their presence calls me from my isolation.\r\nOnce, in days long gone, I was not just Smites-And-Slashes, but a proud warrior of the An-Xileel, wielding a Trident that danced through the waters like a serpent on a hunt. Those were fierce times, when our kind battled fiercely against the tides of destiny, defending our sacred homeland of Black Marsh from threats within and without. The Hist guided our actions, and the Argonians of those days were bound by a shared purpose.\r\nBut the winds of time shift as imperceptibly as the currents beneath the sea's surface, and as the years ebbed away, I found myself longing for a simpler existence. Life as an An-Xileel warrior had left its scars upon my scales, both seen and unseen. I retired my Trident from the battlefield and turned it into a tool for survival, using it primarily for fishing, as the Sea of Ghosts provides sustenance to those who dare to cast their nets.\r\nYet, boredom is a relentless beast that lurks in the shadowy depths of solitude. The thrill of combat calls to me once more, like a siren's song, and I find myself yearning for the adrenaline-fueled days of my youth. For the right price, I would gladly lift my Trident once more and plunge headlong into battle, defending those in need or taking up arms for a cause that stirs my heart. I hear dragons have awoken, and perhaps they too can be speared.\r\nThe solitude of the Wreck of the Crown Petone is my sanctuary, but the promise of adventure still lingers in the recesses of my mind. The tides of fate may yet carry me to new shores.",
