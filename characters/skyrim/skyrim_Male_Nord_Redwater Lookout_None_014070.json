    "bio": "Redwater Lookout is a man guarding the trapdoor entrance down into Redwater Den. Redwater Den is an underground cave system located in a remote hilly area in the northern section of the Rift. Inside Redwater Den, this lookout's employers sell a special variety of skooma (an illegal narcotic drug) called Redwater skooma.\r\nA woman is helping this man guard the trapdoor entrance, which is surrounded by a half-destroyed abanoned old house. This male lookout and his female companion lookout are secretly thralls of a vampire, who currently resides deep within Redwater Den. These lookouts will not admit to being enthralled by a vampire.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Hey there, friend. If you're looking for a fix, you're at the right place. Just head on down the trap door.\"\r\n\"I got nothing on me. If you're looking for skooma, head on downstairs.\"\r\n\"If you're buying, go on in. Otherwise, shove off.\"",
