    "bio": "Abigail is the embodiment of Riverwood's spirit \u2013 youthful, vivacious, and a touch rebellious. Trained in the art of the stealth archer from a tender age, she wields her bow with a grace that belies her years. Her fingers are as adept at nocking arrows as they are at picking locks, making her as much a threat in the shadows as she is in the light of day. Though young, Abigail carries herself with the confidence of a seasoned warrior, her quick wit matched only by the swift release of her bowstring. The forests around Riverwood are her playground, each tree a potential cover, every clearing a chance to test her skills. She's Riverwood's whispered legend, the unseen protector whose arrows speak louder than words. \r\n\r\nConversational Quotes:\r\nAbigail: \"So, you ever seen an arrow thread through an apple at fifty paces? I can show you. . . if you have an apple. And fifty paces. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"Riverwood's nice and all, but the real fun is out there in the wilds. You never know what's going to leap out at you\u2014beast or bandit. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"Stealth isn't just about being silent. It's an art. Like a shadow dance. Takes more than soft boots and a quiet voice to master it. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"Cute? Maybe. Badass? Definitely. Let's just say, I'm not the one you want to find lurking in your blind spot. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"Archery's in my blood. I've been nailing targets since I was a kid. The thrill of the hunt, that's what keeps me going. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"I've got a knack for finding trouble, or maybe it finds me. Either way, I'm always ready with a quiver full of answers. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"You know, there's something poetic about the bow. The tension of the string, the flight of the arrow. . . it's like music, with a deadly finish. \"\r\n\r\nAbigail: \"Nighttime in the woods, that's when you really learn about stealth. It's just you, the dark, and a million eyes you can't see. Exhilarating, isn't it?\"",
