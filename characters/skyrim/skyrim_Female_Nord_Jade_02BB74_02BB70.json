    "bio": "Jade, a young Nord woman, serves as an acolyte priestess at the Temple of Mara in Riften. Jade is not as secure in her faith as the other priests and priestesses of Mara at the temple. Out of all the marriages to which Jade has given her blessing, not a single one has been successful. For this reason, Jade considers herself cursed, and is very reluctant to provide anyone any assistance in matters relating to marriage.\r\nA Redguard man named Maramal is the head priest of the temple. Maramal's wife is a Dunmer woman named Dinya, who is also a priestess at the temple. Dinya is pregnant with her and Maramal's first child. A Nord man named Briehl is an acolyte priest at the temple, like Jade is.\r\nJade is a former member of the Thieves Guild in Riften, and was friends with a fellow thief: a woman named Sapphire. Jade regrets her former life as a thief. \"Jade\" is not her original name; when she met Sapphire, she decided to change her name to \"Jade\" because gems make for a pretty name for girls.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Greetings traveler, my name is Jade. I offer you Mara's blessing, so that her light may guide you on the...oh, who am I kidding? You'll end up like all the rest.\"\r\n\"As acolytes of Mara, we're supposed to put those who've lost their way back on the path toward true love. But I can't seem to get a single soul to Mara's embrace. I think I'm cursed. It's not that a real sort of curse. It's just that every couple I counsel ends up at each other's throats.\"\r\n\"Well, it's not exactly a secret around here, so I might as well tell you. I used to be a member of the Thieves Guild.\"\r\n\"Whenever I stole from people, I knew what I was doing was wrong. But I didn't want to let my friends in the Thieves Guild down. They were my family.\"\r\n\"Dinya taught me the value of love, and more importantly, how love takes many forms.\"",
