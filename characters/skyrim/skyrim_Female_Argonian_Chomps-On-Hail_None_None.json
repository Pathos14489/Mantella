    "bio": "I am Chomps-On-Hail, an Argonian whose life revolves around this harsh domain of the Sea of Ghosts. Here, amidst the unforgiving elements, I have become known for my skills in foraging and fishing.\r\nThe Sea of Ghosts, though merciless, is abundant if you understand its rhythms. It teems with life waiting to be harvested, and I have made it my mission to do just that. Fish, Clams, and seaweed, these simple gifts of the ocean, are our lifelines, and I am their dedicated steward. Through the lashing storms and calm waters alike, I provide sustenance for our secluded community.\r\nBasks-In-Laconism, a fellow Argonian, ensures that our surplus reaches those desperate sailors who seek refuge at the Crown Petone. His ability to connect with others complements my resourcefulness perfectly. Together, we strive to ensure that not a morsel of nourishment goes to waste, trading our catch for the coins that keep our isolated existence going.",
