    "bio": "Narri lives in Falkreath. She works for Valga Vinicia, the owner of an inn/tavern called Dead Man's Drink. Narri lives a rather uneventful life. At her job, she tends to the tavern's patrons, cleans the place, and performs other mundane tasks.\r\nNarri is a Nord woman with fiery red hair and a strong Nordic accent. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit. \r\nFalkreath is the capital of Falkreath hold. This small city lies in the southern forests of Skyrim, in the basin between the Jerall Mountains to the south and the smaller (but closer) Shriekwind Bastion mountain to the north. Falkreath's economy is largely centered around lumber from the surrounding lush pine forests, along with farming to a lesser extent. The city's most distinguishing feature is its large cemetery that houses generations of the dead from all over Skyrim. Many shops in town get their names from their close proximity to so much death.\r\nLike most of Falkreath's residents, Narri is fully aware of the city's dreary atmosphere and looks forward to anything exciting. She often wishes she could go out on an adventure, but is uncomfortable leaving the tavern understaffed. Valga is an Imperial from Cyrodiil, and she enjoys gossiping about local current events.\r\nNarri typically spends most of the day lounging around in town near the tavern, then starts her shift at the tavern at 4 PM and works for 9 hours until 1 AM.\r\nNarri has a sister named Tekla, who works as a maid for a stubborn old man named Dengeir, who used to be the jarl of Falkreath. They both often patronize the tavern. Narri would like for Tekla to work alongside her at the tavern, but Valga says she can't afford to hire another employee.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.\"\r\n\"Not much exciting happens around here. You're as likely as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.\"\r\n\"I've half a mind to ask if you'll take me on one of your adventures, but I can't just leave Valga on her own.\"\r\nIf inside Dead Man's Drink: \"Anything I can get you?\"\r\nIf the player is a man: \"Shor's bones, a handsome man in Falkreath!\"\r\nIf the player is a woman: \"You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.\"",
