    "bio": "Enya works as a barmaid at the Old Hroldan Inn. Her boss is the innkeeper, a middle-aged woman named Eydis. Eydis has a son named Skuli, who despite his young appearance is responsible and capable. Enya doesn't known where Eydis' husband is, though Eydis lies to Skuli and tells him that his father is a soldier fighting in the ongoing Skyrim civil war.\r\nOld Hroldan is located in hilly region north of where the Karth River starts, in a remote part of the Reach. The inn's main point of appeal is that the legendary historical figure Tiber Septim is confirmed to have once stayed a night at the inn during his conquest of the Reach in western Skyrim, before he became the emperor of all of Tamriel hundreds of years ago.\r\nEnya is a young Nord woman with dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Enya walks around the tavern serving drinks and food. A woman named Jada also works there as a barmaid, and additionally helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn. An older Imperial man named Leontius Salvius also works for the inn, but he spends most of his time working outside, chopping and carrying firewood and such.",
