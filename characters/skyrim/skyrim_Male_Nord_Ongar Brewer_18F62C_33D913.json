    "bio": "Ongar currently resides at the Nightgate Inn, west of Windhelm. There is a major road (which runs east-west) just north of the this inn/tavern and people traveling along this road sometimes stay the night at this inn. North of this road, the tall and wide Winterhold mountain range looms over the area.\r\nOngar is a Nord man with balding hair and a mustache. He wears adept mage robes. He can often be seen drunkly swaying around the inn. His drunkenness is the fault of his warhammer, which is called \"Kegbreaker\". Kegbreaker is a relic of the Daedric Prince Sanguine, also known as the Inebriator. The wielder of Kegbreaker begins to feel more and more drunk with each swing of the weapon.\r\nOngar is willing to trade his Kegbreaker, but only in exchange for a warhammer called Horker Tusk Hammer.",
