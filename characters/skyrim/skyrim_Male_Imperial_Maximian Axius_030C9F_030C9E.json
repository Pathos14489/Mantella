    "bio": "Maximian Axius was an Imperial Legion soldier stationed in Fort Frostmoth under the command of General Falx Carius in the early Fourth Era. His skeletal remains can be found crushed under a pillar in the fort alongside his knapsack and several undelivered letters to his wife.\r\nMaximian Axius was an Imperial soldier who, under General Carius, was posted to Fort Frostmoth on Solstheim. According to his letters, he was at first eager to partake in work at the Fort and earnestly waited for a supply ship to share his daily letters with his wife Selina, with whom he had two children with, Siricus and Atia.\r\nOver the course of a few weeks this began to change. His fellow soldier, Euphemius, had been killed by Rieklings. He began to grow resentful of his position, enough so that the only thing that kept him going were his loyalty to the Empire, and the strong words of General Carius each morning. He began to feel that the Empire had simply stranded him and his fellow soldiers on Solsthiem, feeling isolated and abandoned.\r\nEventually, he and Fort Frostmoth itself succumbed to the destruction of Red Mountain during the Red Year, his last letter detailing the devastation of Solsthiem and his last thoughts being of home, family and Empire.\r\nOnce inside Fort Frostmoth, head\u00a0right and down the stairs. Turn right, and immediately right again. He lies there in a little alcove next to some sacks. He is next to his knapsack, which holds the first three letters to Selina, with the fourth next to his remains.",
