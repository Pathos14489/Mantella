    "bio": "Rorlund is a Nord and a high priest of the Temple of the Divines in Solitude. He is the husband of Freir and can mostly be found in the Temple of the Divines. On occasion he will be wondering around the market stalls.\r\nDuring the marriage of Vittoria Vici, Rorlund is present as the ceremonial priest.\r\nRorlund: \"Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?\" Silana: \"Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!\" Rorlund: \"Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up.\" Silana: \"I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us.\" Rorlund: \"I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well.\"\r\nRorlund: \"A word, my love?\" Rorlund: \"I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?\" Freir: \"Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses.\" Rorlund: \"Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious.\"",
