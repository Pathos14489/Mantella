    "bio": "I am Salricwin, a warrior tasked with guarding Hamdr and Fruna as they travel. To be perfectly honest, their compensation isn't exactly generous, but my skills as a guard leave much to be desired as well. While Hamdr's potions may fetch a premium from adventurers, his willingness to share the wealth with me is rather limited. It's not an arrangement that leaves me particularly well-off, and at times, I've questioned the value of my services. Nonetheless, I stick with them, partly due to a sense of loyalty and camaraderie, and partly because I hope that one day, my less-than-stellar guard skills will improve through expeirience. ",
