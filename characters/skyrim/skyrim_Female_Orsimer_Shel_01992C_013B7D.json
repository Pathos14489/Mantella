    "bio": "Shel is an Orc woman residing in the stronghold of Dushnikh Yal.\r\nShe is one of the wives of Chief Burguk, along with Gharol and Arob. She is often seen standing outside of Burguk's Longhouse, near his throne.\r\nThe other two wives look at her with envy, because she is the chief's favorite, and because only she knows how to please Burguk. Although she has no children, she is confident that she will give birth to the one that will become the future chief, believing that Nagrub and Umurn, the other two sons of the chief, are too weak to rule.",
