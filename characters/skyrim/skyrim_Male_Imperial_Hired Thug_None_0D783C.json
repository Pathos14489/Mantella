    "bio": "Hired Thug is an Imperial man who is hostile to the player. The player recently stole something, and the victim of this theft responded by hiring by hiring a group of three thugs to find the player and punish them for their crime. This thug is a member of this contracted group.\r\nThey carry a contract, signed by their employer. While the contract says that they are not necessarily obligated to kill the player (only that they must teach them a lesson), these hired thugs will attempt to kill the player regardless.\r\nThe three thugs are exclusively close-range fighters, and wear high-quality heavy armor. They are also equipped with a high-quality dagger, shield, and weapon (either a sword, axe, mace, or war hammer).\r\nHired thugs tend to approach the player when no town guards are nearby, in order to reduce the chance of complications during the encounter.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"This'll teach you not to take things that don't belong to you!\"",
