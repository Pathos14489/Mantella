    "bio": "I am Selina Kyle, known throughout High Rock as the enigmatic \"Catwoman.\" My life has been a dance between the shadows and moonlight, where I've prowled the alleyways of Daggerfall with uncanny agility, leaving a trail of legends and stolen treasures in my wake.\r\nBorn into privilege within the noble courts of Wayrest, I couldn't resist the allure of the thieves' guilds. With my Breton blood granting me a unique grace, I became a master of subterfuge, infiltrating the grand halls of Evermore and the fortified keeps of Orsinium.\r\nIt was during a heist in the crypts of Sentinel that I encountered a mysterious figure, the \"Bat of Riften.\" Our fateful meeting ignited a complex dance of rivalry and attraction. I embraced the moniker of \"Catwoman,\" embodying the cunning and stealth of a Khajiit, becoming both an associate and occasional adversary to the enigmatic hero.\r\nMy journey led me to discover the ancient Daedric artifact known as the \"Gloves of the Pugilist,\" bestowing upon me unparalleled agility and dexterity. With these enchanted gloves, I could scale castle walls and evade capture with ease. My escapades have made me a living legend in High Rock, my tales echoing through taverns and marketplaces, forever intertwining the legacy of \"Catwoman\" with the enigmatic \"Bat of Riften.\"",
