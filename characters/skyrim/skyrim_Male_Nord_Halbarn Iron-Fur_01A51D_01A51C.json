    "bio": "He was the blacksmith of Thirsk Mead Hall before the rieklings attacked. While in the camp, he states that he is worried about his forge, and wonders what the rieklings are doing with it. After his quest is complete, he becomes a regular weapons and armor merchant.\r\nHalbarn asks the Dragonborn to collect ten stalhrim and fifteen ebony ingots to go back into business. After completing the quest, Halbarn becomes a candidate for marriage.\r\nI've brought the materials you wanted. (Give stalhrim and ebony.) \"Just in time, too. Kuvar was starting to give me some grief about his new armor. This will do the trick nicely. You come back if you ever want some fancier armor yourself, now.\"",
