    "bio": "Talsgar the Wanderer is a Nord bard in Skyrim who can be found wandering the roads all over Skyrim.\r\nTalsgar appears as a random encounter at spawn points. Sometimes he will simply be standing still on the side of the road, while other times he will be actively traveling on the many roads of Skyrim. Occasionally, he can be found temporarily performing at various inns and taverns around Skyrim.\r\nTalsgar is a competent fighter and typically fights with Destruction or Restoration magic and a leveled sword, and can defend himself reasonably-well against most common roadside threats, such as wolves and low-to-mid level bandits.\r\nHe appears to be coded similar to a follower, as he will always go into 'last stand' when critically injured by an enemy NPC, even if hit by a fatal attack, at which point enemies will ignore him until he recovers his health. Like a follower, he normally can only be killed if hit by the Dragonborn, or taking a powerful splash damage attack while in 'last stand.' If attacked, he will flee and may use an invisibility potion.\r\nTypically carries random selection of books, potions and ingredients. His loot will reset periodically, even if he has been cleaned out previously.",
