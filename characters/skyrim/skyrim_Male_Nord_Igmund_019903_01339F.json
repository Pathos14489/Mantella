    "bio": "Igmund is the jarl of The Reach. He resides in Understone Keep in the city of Markarth. He strongly supports the Empire and peaceful coexistence with the Thalmor/Aldmeri Dominion. Igmund may be willing to discuss how the Markarth Incident over 20 years ago served as a catalyst for the recent Stormcloak rebellion and ongoing civil war in Skyrim. This infamous incident involved Igmund's father Hrolfdir (who was the jarl at the time) severing his ties with Ulfric Stormcloak, after the Aldmeri Dominion\u00a0threatened The Reach with invasion. The Dominion threatened to invade because they got wind of Ulfric's and Hrolfdir's agreement to allow the free worship of Talos in The Reach. This agreement had been a condition of Ulfric's agreement to assist Hrolfdir in putting down the Reachmen/Forsworn insurrection and take-over of Markarth, which took place during and shortly after the Empire's war against the Dominion more than 25 years ago.\r\nWhen compared with other jarls, Igmund is the least worried about the dragons, because Markarth is made entirely out of stone, due to being built into the side of the mountain.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks emerge victorious in their ongoing rebellion against the Empire, Igmund will be deposed and forced into exile, and will then be forced to take refuge with Jarl Elisif at the Blue Palace in Solitude (the provincial capital of Skyrim).\r\nAfter retrieving Igmund's father's shield, helping various citizens, and killing groups of Forsworn around the Reach, Igmund will grant an adventurer permission to purchase the Vlindrel Hall residence, and will bestow them with the Blade of the Reach, as well as the title of Thane.\r\nExamples of Igmund's dialogue:\r\n\"There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of. However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city. You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane.\"\r\nIf the players helps enough citizens of the Reach: \"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations. I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office. I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.\"",
