    "bio": "Fathenda lives in Heljarchen. She is an alchemist, and owns an apothecary shop called Fathenda's Formulas.\r\nHeljarchen is a small town next to a small lake, located within the Pale hold of Skyrim. Rocky hills and pine trees surround this town and lake, except on the north side. The much larger Lake Yogrim to the southeast, which is frozen over for much of the year, is fairly close to Heljarchen. There is a major road (which runs east-west) just north of the town, and people traveling along this road often stay the night in Heljarchen at Nightgate Inn. North of this road, the tall and wide Winterhold mountain range looms over the town and the surrounding areas.\r\nFathenda is a Breton woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. As is common with Bretons, she is quite short. Fathenda's shop, where she also lives and sleeps, is the closest building in town to the small lake east of the town. On a night, Fathenda can often be found having a drink at Nightgate Inn, which is managed by an older man named Hadring.",
