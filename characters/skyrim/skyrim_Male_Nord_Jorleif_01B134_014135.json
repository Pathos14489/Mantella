    "bio": "Jorleif proudly serves as the court steward for Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak of Windhelm. He lives and works in the Palace of the Kings. He is a Nord man, with light brown hair and a thick mustache. He typically wears a bright-colored set of merchant clothes, with a hat and a pair of boots.\r\nJorleif begins his day by waking up early and heading downstairs to the throne room to attend to his duties. At lunch time, he usually eats in the long table in the center of the throne room. He continues attending to his duties until after sundown.\r\nJorleif admits his inability to properly assist with the tactical aspect of the Stormcloaks' ongoing war against the Empire, though Ulfric sometimes still asks for his input on such matters. If anyone has information pertinent to the ongoing conflict, Jorleif recommends that they speak to Ulfric about it.\r\nIf the player has sufficiently furthered the Stormcloak cause in the war against the Empire and is thus being considered for being named a Thane of Eastmarch by Jarl Ulfric, Jorleif will be willing to sell them (for between 8000 and 12000 gold) the currently unoccupied Hjerim property in the high-end western residential area of the city. If adequately paid, Jorleif can also arrange for various renovations and decorations to the property.\r\nIf asked about bounties within Eastmarch Hold, Jorleif usually has bounty notices to provide.\r\nJorleif sometimes reports to Ulfric on the issues in the Gray Quarter of the city. There is unrest with the Dark Elf refugee inhabitants there, who are not particularly sympathetic to the Stormcloak cause.\r\nJorleif will be happy to accept help in investigating the recent string of murders in the city. A serial killer (who Windhelm's residents now refer to as \"The Butcher\") has murdering young women at night. An annoying older woman named Viola Giordano has been trying to investigate the Butcher on her own, but she clearly doesn't know what she's doing.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The Stormcloaks are finding victory across the land.\"\r\n\"I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same.\"\r\n\"If you have any news of the western holds, take it to Ulfric immediately.\"\r\n\"Terrible shame, what happened to those women.\"\r\nIf asked what he does for the jarl: \"For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years. He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that. I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time.\"\r\nIf asked about Windhelm: \"Grew up here. Cold as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker! Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.\"\r\nIf offered assistance in investigating the recent murders: \"These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts. My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary. I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well.\"\r\nWhen ending conversation: \"Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.\"\r\n\"If you'll excuse me, I must return to my duties.\"",
