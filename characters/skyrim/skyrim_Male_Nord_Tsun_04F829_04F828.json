    "bio": "Tsun is the ancient god of trials against adversity in the Nordic pantheon. He served as shield-thane to Shor and died defending him from foreign gods during the Ehlnofey wars of the Dawn Era. In the ancient Nordic pantheon, he is often depicted as a bear.\r\nTsun is extremely tall. He wears a unique set of armor and wields a unique ancient Nord battleaxe.\r\nTsun guards the whalebone bridge to the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde and tests all who wish to pass in a trial by combat. The Dragonborn (the player) must defeat Tsun in combat to gain entrance to the Hall of Valor to meet with the Tongues (the three warriors who eons ago fought and banished Alduin into the future).\r\nIf the Dragonborn defeats Alduin, Tsun will congratulates them. Before sending the Dragonborn back to Mundus, Tsun will grant them a boon; imparting knowledge of the three words of the shout Call of Valor, allowing the Dragonborn to summon one of the three Tongues from Sovngarde to aid them in battle.",
