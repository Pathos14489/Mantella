    "bio": "Mithorpa Nasyal is a farmer who lives and works on a farm located on the vast plains of Whiterun Hold. His farm is named Barleydark Farm. Wolves and giants are common problems in the area. A short distance west of the farm, there is a strange cluster of small stone structures, of ancient Nordic origin. The Brittleshin Hills mountains are visible to the southeast of the farm.\r\nMithorpa is a Dunmer. He wears typical farmer clothing. He grows potatoes, wheat, and squash. He also raises chickens and cows, and has a dog.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I am but a humble farmer. Not a\u2026 a great wanderer, like you.\"\r\n\"The Grey Quarter in Windhelm is little more than a slum. Thank the Divines I can choose to live somewhere else.\"\r\nIf speaking to a fellow Dunmer: \"Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.\"",
