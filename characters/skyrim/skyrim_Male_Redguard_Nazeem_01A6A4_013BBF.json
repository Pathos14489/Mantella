    "bio": "Nazeem is a Redguard citizen in Skyrim who resides in the upstairs room of The Drunken Huntsman. He, along with his wife Ahlam, owns Chillfurrow Farm, which is located south of Whiterun.\r\nDuring waking hours, he visits the marketplace and inspects the wares on display, while conversing with, and insulting, various merchants. In the afternoon, he wanders around town, and then finishes his day by sitting in The Drunken Huntsman. He also goes to bed there instead of Chillfurrow Farm.\r\nHe speaks in a condescending manner toward the Dragonborn and the citizens of Whiterun, and claims to advise Balgruuf the Greater on political matters.",
