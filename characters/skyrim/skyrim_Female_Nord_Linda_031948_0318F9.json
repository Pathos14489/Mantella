    "bio": "Linda lives in Dawnstar. She works as a barmaid at the Windpeak Inn, which is run by a widower named Thoring. Thoring's young adult daughter Karita works as a bard at the inn, taking after her late mother (a trained bard from the Bards College in Solitude). A woman named Abelone works as a maid at the inn. A Redguard woman named Jane also works as a barmaid there, and helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.\r\nDawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice.\r\nLinda is a young Nord woman with long dark brown hair and green eyes. She wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit, typical of barmaids in Skyrim. When working, Linda walks around the tavern serving drinks and food.",
