    "bio": "Ganna Uriel is an Imperial found in Kynesgrove. She also works and wanders around the Steamscorch Mine. She has a sister named Gemma Uriel.\r\nGanna will pay the Dragonborn 5 gold for each piece of firewood brought to her. In conversation, Ganna will talk about a grove on the hillside that turned out to be sacred, and therefore uncuttable, rendering her family's mill in Kynesgrove useless, and she and her sister are unable to afford the purchase of a new mill elsewhere.\r\nGanna: \"I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.\" Ganna: \"And a whole lot of good that's gotten us.\"\r\nGemma: \"There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.\" Ganna: \"Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?\" Ganna: \"I'll let you explain that one to the Nords.\" Ganna: \"Gemma. This town is called 'Kynesgrove.' That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down.\" Ganna: \"Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.\"",
