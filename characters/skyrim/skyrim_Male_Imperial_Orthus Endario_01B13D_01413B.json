    "bio": "Orthus Endario is an Imperial entrepreneur in Skyrim who resides in Windhelm, at the East Empire Company Office on the Windhelm Docks.\r\nHe starts his day at 7 am and eats breakfast for an hour. He then goes to the office and wanders around or sweeps the floor. At 1 pm, Orthus goes outside to the docks and works until 6 pm. At 6 pm, he goes back into the office to have dinner.\r\nOrthus asks the Dragonborn for help concerning his business going south due to the pillaging Blood Horkers.\r\nIf Rise in the East has been completed prior to this quest, the Dragonborn may request his aid in distracting the Thalmor guards.\r\n",
