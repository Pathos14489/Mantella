    "bio": "Bulfrek is a Nord man living in Dawnstar who works as a servant to Jarl Skald the Elder at The White Hall. He has dark hair and a thin beard. Bulfrek\u2019s family have been serving the rulers of The Pale for generations. He wears a belted tunic.\r\nBulfrek is resentful regarding Skald's lack of respect towards him. Skald will often poke fun at Bulfrek, mocking Bulfrek's ambitions to join the Stormcloaks, and giving Bulfrek tedious and frivolous tasks like polishing entire bundles of freshly made weapons. Bulfrek can often be found sweeping the floor while making comments about his dislike for Skald under his breath. \r\nIf the Imperial Legion takes control of Dawnstar during the course of the Skyrim Civil War, Bulfrek will be forced to join Skald in fleeing Dawnstar and taking refuge in the Palace of Kings in Windhelm. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"There's no honor in being a Jarl's servant. No Sovngarde waits for the dust cleaners.\"\r\n\"My family has served Skald Felgeif's family for generations.\"\r\n\"By the Divines, I'm tired.\"\r\n\"I\u2019m just a servant of Skald the Elder. Not worthy of time or consideration.\"\r\n\"Oh it's just wonderful being Skald's servant. He's not demanding in the least...\"",
