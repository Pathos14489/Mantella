    "bio": "Celann is a member of the Dawnguard, a group of vampire hunters.\r\nThe leader of the Dawnguard is a stoic, deadly serious Redguard man named Isran. Years ago, Celann and Isran were members of the Vigilants of Stendarr, an order dedicated to wiping out Daedra-worship, vampires, werewolves, witches, and other abominations. Dissatisfied with the Vigilants', Celann and Isran left the order and worked together, though their partnership did not last long. The increased frequency and severity of vampire attacks in Skyrim made Celann recently decide to rejoin Isran and his new order.\r\nThe Dawnguard's base of operations is the ancient Fort Dawnguard in Dayspring Canyon, southeast of Riften and hidden deep in the Velothi Mountains. Built in the Second Era by the Jarl of Riften, this large castle served to contain the Jarl of Riften's son after he became a vampire. To prevent his son from leaving the castle, the Jarl hired a group of mercenaries known as the Dawnguard, who extended their purpose to root out any vampiric presence in Skyrim. The original Dawnguard eventually disbanded hundreds of years ago, but Isran recently rediscovered and repaired their old castle and reformed the Dawnguard order.\r\nThe first three members of the new Dawnguard were Isran, Celann, and an orc named Durak. Other members join afterwards.\r\nIf the player has become a member of the Dawnguard, Celann will be willing to follow them on missions. Celann will even be willing to be hired as the steward of one of the player's residential properties.\r\nCelann is a Breton. He has blue eyes, light brown hair, and a beard. He is a lawful man and does not tolerate crime. He is clad in a set of Dawnguard light armor. This includes a gray cuirass and matching pairs of gauntlets and boots. He is equipped with a Dawnguard war axe and carries a torch. While Celann primarily fights as a warrior, he can use Sun Fire, an apprentice-level spell which is useful against vampires and other members of the undead.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Here to join the Dawnguard? Good.\"\r\n\"Isran will decide if you've got what it takes. Go on, he's right inside.\"\r\n\"I'll tell you, the only thing more surprising than hearing from Isran after all these years was hearing that he wanted my help. I immediately realized things must be pretty bad. Looks like I was right.\"\r\nIf asked if he's worked with Isran before: \"I have. There was a time, years ago, when we were both members of the Vigilants, and both equally dissatisfied with them. Their hearts are in the right place, of course. But Isran and I were never comfortable. We left together, but that partnership didn't last very long. I didn't agree with some of his methods.\"\r\n\"May you always prevail.\"\r\n\"Isran found something for you to do, eh? I thought he'd like you. Good luck!\"",
