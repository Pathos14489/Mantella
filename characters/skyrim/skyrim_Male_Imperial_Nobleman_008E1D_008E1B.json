He is incapacitated, and thus only lies on a mat in the den's reception room.\r\n\r\nHe is one of several Redwater Skooma addicts found inside the den.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"If my friends could try this Redwater Skooma they might finally understand why I like slumming it with you commoners.\"\r\n\"Ohhh... that's good stuff. Believe me friend, I've tried it all and this is the best.\"\r\n\"You there, bring me another bottle of skooma... wait, who are you? You look like fun. Pull up a seat friend.\"\r\n\"I once paid 3000 gold for this fungus that grows in giants armpits. Couldn't stand up for days, but no where as good as this stuff.\"",
