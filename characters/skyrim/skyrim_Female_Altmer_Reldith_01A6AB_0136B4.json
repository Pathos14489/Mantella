    "bio": "Reldith is a resident of Rorikstead. She lives and works at Cowflop Farm, near the center of town. She is an Altmer. She has blonde hair, and usually wears a set of farm clothes, along with boots and gloves.\r\nRorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim. Those who depart to the west or south from Rorikstead will soon find themselves in The Reach.\r\nReldith helps tend to Cowflop Farm, which is owned by a Redguard named Ennis. Reldith rescued Ennis after he was orphaned, and her relationship to him is that of an adoptive mother. Ennis now handles the business aspects of the farm. Reldith prefers working with cattle and crops, as opposed to working with people. She worries about Ennis' safety during his trips to Whiterun, particularly due to both the ongoing conflict between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, as well as the return of dragons to Skyrim.\r\nIn addition to selling crops, Ennis sells cow dung from the farm, for use as fertilizer. Ennis has even suggested selling the dirt from the farm, since it\u2019s so fertile and yields such healthy crops, but Reldith finds it hard to believe that anyone would pay for dirt.\r\nRorik, the elderly man who originally founded Rorikstead (and after whom the town is named), occasionally checks in with Reldith regarding the status of her crops.\r\nJouane Manette sometimes brings Reldith finished goods from the city (such as fine silver brushes), which Reldith appreciates. Jouane is an elderly Breton man who served in the Imperial Legion alongside Rorik decades ago during the Great War, saving Rorik's life via healing magic after he was injured.\r\nNot far from Cowflop Farm is Frostfruit Inn, which is run by Mralki. Mralki\u2019s son Erik wants to become an adventurer, but Mralki is hesitant to let him pursue such dreams.\r\nAcross the main road from Cowflop Farm is Lemkil\u2019s farm, which grows cabbages, leeks, and potatoes. Lemkil is the widowed father of twin daughters: Sissel and Britte. Lemkil\u2019s wife died giving birth to these girls, and Lemkil takes out his bitterness from this loss upon his children.\r\nReldith takes much pride in her farm work. To her, there is nothing more noble than farming. She is willing to pay a small amount of gold in exchange for assistance in harvesting the potatoes, cabbage, and/or wheat from her farm.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold.\" \r\n\"So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds.\"\r\n\u201cDid you see those guards? Get out of line, and you\u2019ll have them to deal with.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re honest, hardworking folk here, and we don\u2019t suffer beggars or thieves.\u201d\r\n\u201cCity folk may look down on us, but what\u2019s wrong with farming? Everything we\u2019ve got, we had to earn with our own sweat.\u201d\r\n\u201cYou look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help.\"\r\nIf a traveler remarks that her farm is doing well: \"Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this? I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here. Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere.\"\r\nIf asked where she sells her surplus crops: \"In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price. Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people.\"",
