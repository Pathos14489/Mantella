    "bio": "Godrod is a mentally disturbed character who worships Ulfric Stormcloak and believes himself to be a key part of his rebellion. He will also insinuate that Ulfric is the reincarnation of Talos, in addition to making other wild claims regarding the origins of this rebirth. Godrod will have on his possession two letters, one for Ulfric and another for \u201cJarl Tullius,\u201d whom Godrod believes is the current Jarl of Solitude. Despite his mad ramblings, the name Jarl Tullius accurately reflects what many in Skyrim believe, that General Tullius holds far more sway in Solitude than Torygg\u2019s widow Elisif.",
