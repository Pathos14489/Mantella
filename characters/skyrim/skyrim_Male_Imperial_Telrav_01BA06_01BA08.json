    "bio": "Telrav is an Imperial bandit in Skyrim who is found on the road to Ivarstead, northwest of Sarethi Farm.\r\nTelrav is a leveled bandit who impersonates a wounded merchant who has been the victim of a robbery. While traveling, his cart was ransacked and looted by nearby bandits. He convinces the Dragonborn to help him regain his cart, luring him or her into an ambush by the other bandits, which he joins in combat.\r\nAs Telrav wears no armor, he remains vulnerable to melee attacks. His consorts are leveled, making them more difficult.",
