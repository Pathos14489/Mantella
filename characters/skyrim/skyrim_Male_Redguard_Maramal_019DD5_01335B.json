    "bio": "Maramal\u00a0is a Redguard priest who can be found in the Bee and Barb or in the Temple of Mara in Riften. He can sell an Amulet of Mara to the Dragonborn, allowing them to marry. He will be at the Bee and Barb the first time Riften is visited.\r\nMaramal is a member of the Cult of Mara and can hold weddings at the Temple of Mara between the Dragonborn and a chosen potential spouse.\r\nI wanted to know more about the Temple of Mara. \"Wonderful. Where to begin? Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost. We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.\"\r\nDo you accept charity? \"Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box. Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get.\"\r\nCan you tell me about Mara's beliefs? \"Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding. It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm.\"\r\nMaramal's wife Dinya is pregnant with their first child.",
