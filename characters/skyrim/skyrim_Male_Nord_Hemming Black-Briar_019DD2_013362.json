    "bio": "Hemming Black-Briar is a Nord and the eldest son and heir of Maven Black-Briar and brother to Sibbi and Ingun. He lives in Riften, in the Black-Briar Manor. \r\nHemming wears Fine Clothes and a Fine Hat, like many of the Black-Briar family. It is widely acknowledged that Hemming doesn't have the same power as Maven, and seems to live under her thumb. For instance, if she becomes the Jarl of Riften after Laila Law-Giver leaves, he becomes her steward.",
