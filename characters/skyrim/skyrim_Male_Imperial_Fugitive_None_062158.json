    "bio": "This fugitive is a bandit who recently stole an enchanted weapon from a hunter. This hunter is now in close pursuit, and is trying to kill the fugitive and retrieve his stolen weapon. Moments ago, the fugitive spotted the player walking on the road, and decided to hand them the stolen weapon. The fugitive is about to tell the player to temporarily hold onto this weapon until they return for it (after they hopefully evade the hunter's pursuit). The fugitive will also warn the player not to reveal his location, or suffer dire consequences. The fugitive will then continuing running away, so that the angry hunter doesn't catch up with him. The hunter chasing him is quite skilled with his bow, and the fugitive would rather not have to fight him.\r\nThis fugitive bandit is an Imperial man who wears light armor. He carries a shield and a one-handed weapon.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Take this and hold onto it. I'll be back for it later. I'll pay you good. Don't lose it. No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!\"",
