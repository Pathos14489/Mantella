    "bio": "Saerlund is the youngest son of Laila Law-Giver, the jarl of Riften. Saelund lives in Mistveil Keep in Riften. Mistveil Keep is the palace from which his mother governs over Riften and the rest of the Rift. Saelund has an older brother named Harrald.\r\nSaelund is a young Nord man with short brown hair. He typically wears a set of expensive fine clothing.\r\nSaerlund is now the black sheep of his family, because he outspokenly opposes Ulfric Stormcloak. Saerlund sees through Ulfric's lies, and believes that Ulfric cares far more about personal power than he does about Skyrim's freedom. However, Saerlund still acknowledges that the Stormcloak rebellion's goal (Skyrim's religious freedom and independence from the Empire\r\n) is theoretically just. Because of Saerlund's outspoken criticism of Ulfric, his mother has stripped Saerlund of his inheritance, and his brother Harrald has all but disowned him. Saerlund and Harrald often exchange harsh words with each other when they encounter each other in the palace. Saelund and Harrald used to be inseparable, always fighting back to back and letting nothing stand in their way. It is a shame to see what's become of their relationship now. The various staff members at the palace are antagonistic towards Saerlund as well.\r\nLike the rest of eastern Skyrim, Riften and the rest of the the Rift is considered Stormcloak territory, though this has the potential to change as the civil war between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak rebellion further develops.\r\nSaerlund's mother is a well-intentioned but naive ruler, and her decisions are too easily swayed by her court advisors - namely, Anuriel. Anuriel is a Bosmer who works as the court steward, and it seems obvious to Saerlund that she is in the pocket of Maven Black-Briar. Maven is the matriarch of Riften's extremely wealthy and influential Black-Briar family, and those who get in Maven's way often meet an untimely end.\r\nSaerlund mother allows Saerlund to move freely within the palace, but she has forbidden him from leaving it, functionally imprisoning him there. Misguidedly believing that Saerlund is mentally ill (due to his outspoken and locally unpopular political beliefs), Jarl Laila has even asked her court wizard (an absent-minded Bosmer woman named Wylandriah) to diagnose and treat Saerlund's \"condition\".\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?\"\r\n\"I can feel you laughing behind my back.\"\r\n\"Did Harrald send you to taunt me?\"\r\n\"I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind. I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks. Now my mother's stripped me of my inheritance and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me. Be wary what you say around here, friend. You'll find not all take kindly to 'insurrection'.\"\r\nIf asked why he dislikes Ulfric: \"Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way. He's begun a rebellion against those that wish to eradicate the worship of Talos and uses it as his rallying cry. His cause may be true, but the man is a lie... all he holds in his heart is lust for the throne.\"",
