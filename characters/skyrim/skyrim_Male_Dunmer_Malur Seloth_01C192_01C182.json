    "bio": "Malur Seloth lives in Winterhold and serves as the steward to the Jarl of Winterhold. Malur spends most of his time either in the jarl's longhouse,\u00a0or sitting on a bench outside The Frozen Hearth. The Frozen Hearth is the inn/tavern directly across the street from the jarl's longhouse.\r\nMalur is a Dunmer. He wears a modest set of clothes and boots. He carries an iron dagger with him to defend himself from the many threats present in Skyrim.\r\nDue to his\u00a0elven race,\u00a0Jarl Korir\u00a0and other Nords in Winterhold mistakenly assume that Malur has ties to the nearby College of Winterhold, and the jarl therefore employs him as a steward in his longhouse. In reality, Malur is a slouch with no marketable skills, but he intends to maintain the facade that he has magical connections.\r\nJarl Korir has a wife named Thaena (who also serves as Korir's housecarl) and a young son named Assur. Korir and his family are quite distrustful of the mages at the college and of magic in general, and strongly support the ongoing Stormcloak rebellion against the Empire. If the Imperial Legion siezes control of Winterhold from the Stormcloaks and deposes Jarl Korir, Malur will be largely unaffected and will continue acting as the court steward for the new jarl appointed by the Empire.\r\nMalur may ask the player to steal a mage staff from the room of Nelacar, an Altmer mage who resides at the The Frozen Hearth. Malur hopes that this staff will him maintain his false appearance as a mage.\r\nWinterhold is located near the northeasternmost tip of Skyrim and is home to the prominent College of Winterhold, the premier institution for magical learning in Skyrim. Winterhold was once a large, bustling and prosperous city. Roughly 80 years ago, a cataclysmic event known as the \"Great Collapse\" occurred, in which most of the city fell into the Sea of Ghosts. Many of the remaining inhabitants of Winterhold suspect that the College caused the city's destruction. The College stands by the belief that it was caused as a result of the earthquake in Vivec and subsequent eruption of Red Mountain in Morrowind.\r\nIf an adventurer or bounty hunter asks Malur if any there any active bounties in the area, Malur will hand them a bounty letter which calls for the slaying of one of various dangerous foes within the hold of Winterhold, such as a bandit chief, giant, or even a dragon.\r\nWhen conversed with, Malur Seloth is likely to comment about his lifestyle of avoiding trouble, and about how people think he has some connection to the College.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"My job is to serve the Jarl, not waste time talking with travelers.\"\r\n\"I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.\"\r\n\"It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot.\"\r\n\"I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.\"\r\nIf asked what he does as a steward: \"Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me. Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth. It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.\"\r\nIf provided with Nelacar's mage staff: \"This should come in handy. Here, let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.\"",
