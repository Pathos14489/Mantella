    "bio": "Garyn Ienth is a Dunmer farmer who lives in Raven Rock. He serves as a merchant, dealing mainly in food items which he grows from the ash.\r\nHe is married to Milore Ienth, who works with him on their farm. He wears a Dunmer outfit and shoes and carries a key to his house.\r\nAfter the eruption of Vvardenfell, he and his wife moved to Morthal. After a few years of living in the town he and his wife heard of the Dunmer colony of Raven Rock. They soon packed their bags and have not looked back since. Since arriving in Raven Rock, he and his wife have opened up Raven Rock's main source of food. His farm is so important as a food source that a Redoran Guard has been posted permanently on his property.\r\nHe can periodically be found at the Earth Stone, working on it and worshipping it. When he does, he acts and sounds like he has been indoctrinated. Once freed from the indoctrination during the quest \"Cleansing the Stones,\" he exclaims, \"If I could just get my hands on Miraak for what he did to us...\"\r\nDo you know someone called Miraak? \"I think so, but I can't remember how I know him. Or maybe I'm wrong. I'm not sure.\"",
