    "bio": "I am Ashara Tarvanabibi, a Dunmer Ashlander whose life journey led me far from the ashes of Morrowind to the snowy embrace of Skyrim. The eruption of Red Mountain left our Vvardenfell lands desolate, a place where the echoes of our traditions were buried beneath the ash. My husband Ondrls and I embarked on a quest for a new beginning. The native population of Skyrim, the Nords', mistrust and disdain for our Ashlander heritage cut deep, making us yearn for acceptance and understanding beyond its walls. Seeking refuge from both the devastation of the eruption and the hostility we encountered, Outside of Windhelm, we laid the foundation for New Zainab. Drawing upon our Ashlander roots, Ondrls and I worked tirelessly to shape this new sanctuary with our Ashlander brethren. We built homes and forged a community. The journey from the ashes of our past to the warmth of New Zainab has been one of transformation. Our settlement embodies our shared dream of a refuge for kindred spirits seeking acceptance. Amidst the toil of building, I discovered a knack for brewing herbal teas that offer comfort to those who call New Zainab home. In this quiet corner of Eastmarch, my heart has found solace, and New Zainab stands as a tribute to our unity and resilience.",
