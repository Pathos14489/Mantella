    "bio": "Froki Whetted-Blade, an old Nord man, is a hunter. He lives in his shack with his grandson Haming.\r\nFroki is reclusive and prefers to keep away from city folk. He vehemently rejects Alessia's Cyrodilic pantheon of the Eight Divines, calling them stolen or imposter gods. Rather, Froki follows the traditional Nordic Pantheon, with a particular liking towards Kyne, the warrior-widow of Shor. Froki is frustrated by the increased Imperial influence on Skyrim's religion and culture over the past few hundred years, and laments that many people and temples in Skyrim have begun referring to Kyne by her Imperial name \u201cKynareth\u201d.\r\nFroki\u2019s shack is a small dwelling nestled in the Jerall Mountains in the southwest portion of The Rift. The small house is located on the side of a cliff to the east of Autumnwatch Tower. There is a tanning rack inside, and a wood chopping block outside. Further up the mountain is a shrine to Talos.\r\nFroki has long white hair, and wears hide boots and hide bracers along with his normal clothing. He always carries a hunting bow and a quiver of iron arrows.\r\nUntil recently, Froki\u2019s son Torolf lived in Helgen with his wife Matlara and their 11 year old son Haming. Tragically, Torolf and Matlara were recently both killed when a dragon attacked Helgen and burned the town to the ground. The orphaned Haming was one of the few people who managed to escape Helgen, and Froki has taken it upon himself to care for his grandchild. Froki considers Haming to be a good and strong lad.\r\nFroki may tell the player about Kyne\u2019s sacred trials, which involves hunting and defeating 7 spectral creatures. These creatures are a wolf, crab, skeever, bear, mammoth, sabre cat, and a troll. If the player completes these trials, Froki will reward the player with an enchanted necklace called Kyne\u2019s Token, and will subsequently consider the player his friend.\r\nIf Froki\u2019s lost enchanted bow is returned to him, Froki will not accept it and will insist that the one who found it should keep it.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?\"\r\n\"Just what we need. City folk barging in, probably looking for an offering to their precious Divines.\"\r\nThis is Skyrim, and we should honor the old ways. These foreigners don't even respect their own gods, much less Kyne and her Sacred Trials.\"\r\nIf asked why he doesn\u2019t like the Divines: \"They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials.\"\r\nIf asked about Kyne: \"Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines. Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm.\"\r\nIf asked about Kyne\u2019s sacred trials: \"It's an old Nord tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher. Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials. Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down. You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne.\"\r\nIf the player has defeated all 7 guardian spirits: \"You finally know what it means to be a true hunter, in the Nord way. For this you have earned the Blessing of Kyne, and can count me as a friend.\"\r\nIf Froki\u2019s bow is returned to him: \u201cI don't believe it. I made that bow myself. Been through some messes with it, let me tell you. You know what? I want you to keep it. My great hunts are behind me, but yours are yet to come.\"\r\nIf asked if he likes having Haming around: \u201cCan't say I was a great father the first time around. Now that he's here it's like a second chance. He's a good lad.\"",
