    "bio": "Rhorlak is a Nord bandit who lives in Pinewatch. He is only present if the Dragonborn has activated the quest \"Silver Lining.\"\r\nHe acts suspiciously if asked about the silver mold, and can be either bribed into revealing the secret bandit lair below Pinewatch, or threatened, the latter of which will cause him to attack. If the Dragonborn does not talk to him and goes inside Pinewatch Bandit's Sanctuary, he will become hostile.\r\nI'm looking for Endon's mold. \"Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here. I assure you, I have nothing of value. I'm nothing but a poor woodcutter just trying to make ends meet.\"",
