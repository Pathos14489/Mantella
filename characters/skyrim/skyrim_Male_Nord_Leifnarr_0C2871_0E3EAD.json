    "bio": "Leifnarr is a deceased Nord farmer in Skyrim who was killed by a small group of bandits.\r\nAt the Heartwood Mill, west of Riften, Leifnarr's wife, Grosta, or his son, Gralnach, asks to help finding Leifnarr, who has been missing for a few months. His body can be found in Broken Helm Hollow behind a secret door in the rock wall leading to a torture room. Pulling the arrow from Leifnarr's chest causes the Dragonborn to realize that Leifnarr is dead. Grosta will express remorse at his death, chiding herself for assuming he was being unfaithful.",
