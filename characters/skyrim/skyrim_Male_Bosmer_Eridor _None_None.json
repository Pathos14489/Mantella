    "bio": "I am Eridor, a native of Skyrim and has become an exceptional hunter. My survivalist skills have seen me travel from one end of Skyrim to the other in pursuit of the ultimate quarry, although what that is exactly I am not yet sure. I love the thrill of the chase, and no doubt if you offer me the chance to tackle a dragon, you will have won my heart forever. I frequent the Dead Man's Drink, proficient in Archery and Light Armor.",
