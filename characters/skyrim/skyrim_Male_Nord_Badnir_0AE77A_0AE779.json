    "bio": "Badnir is a Nord man who works and resides in the Whistling Mine, southeast of Winterhold.\r\nWhen not mining ore, he can be found near the entrance of the mine, either cooking, sitting or sleeping. He wears Hide Armor and Hide Boots, and wields an Iron Warhammer. He is strongly built and has shoulder-length dark hair.\r\nHe works for Thorgar, the owner of the Whistling Mine. Thorgar believes that they soon will strike something better than iron and become rich. Angvid and Gunding are two of the other miners at the mine, both of them strong Nord men. Badnir, Thoring, Angvid, and Gunding all sleep in bedrolls just inside the mine.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay.\"\r\n\"Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold.\"\r\n\"I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.\"",
