    "bio": "Isabelle Rolaine was a Breton sorceress and thief.\r\nAspiring to solve her and her lover Ranmir's monetary issues, Isabelle temporarily turned to thievery. According to Vex, however, Rolaine lacked the skills necessary, but regardless sent her to Hob's Fall Cave, where she was slain.\r\nRanmir believed that Isabelle left him, as he never learned of her fate post-her disappearance. Ranmir became a drunkard, and took refuge in The Frozen Hearth, in Winterhold.\r\nA letter can be found on Rolaine's corpse, addressed to Ranmir before she traveled to Hob's Fall Cave.",
