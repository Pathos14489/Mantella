    "bio": "Assur is a Nord child and the son of Jarl Korir and Thaena and lives with them in Winterhold inside the Jarl's Longhouse. His family is friends with Brunwulf in Windhelm.\r\nAssur is heavily influenced by his father and repeats his father\u2019s negative opinions regarding magic, but he appears generally neutral. He sometimes plays with Eirid, the only other child in the area, but he constantly makes Eirid play Hunt the elf, with her as the \"elf,\" suggesting a mean streak influenced by his father's negative opinion about elves.\r\nIf the player is known to be a mage, Assur will run up to them and ask them to make him invisible. He may also ask the player if they would like to play a game, such as tag, or hide and seek.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to.\"\r\n\"My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.\"\r\n\"Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.\"\r\n\"Someday I'm gonna grow up and be the Jarl.\"\r\n\"I heard that the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?\"",
