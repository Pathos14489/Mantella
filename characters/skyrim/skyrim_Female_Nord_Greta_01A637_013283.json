    "bio": "Greta is a Nord citizen who resides in Solitude. She is the wife of Addvar, the mother of Svari, and was the sister of Roggvir, until he was executed for aiding Ulfric Stormcloak's escape after he killed High King Torygg. She believes that Captain Aldis understood Roggvir's actions, and took solace in the fact it was he who presided over the execution and no one else, also stating that she would not have been able to stay in Solitude had it not been for him.\r\nUpon first entering Solitude, she can be found to the right, in the crowd gathered to watch the execution of her brother, Roggvir. She can also be found in Addvar's House, in Solitude, as well as wandering around the city.\r\nTalking to Svari, her daughter, will reveal that Greta is upset about the death of Roggvir and has stopped attending the Temple of the Divines. If then spoken to about this, Greta will tell the Dragonborn that she wants to return to the temple, but is unwilling to do so without the Amulet of Talos that her brother wore. She tasks the Dragonborn with retrieving it from Roggvir's body that now resides in Solitude's catacombs. The amulet is in the stone coffin to the left of the entrance in the second alcove.\r\nHi. Svari asked me to talk to you. \"She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later.\"",
