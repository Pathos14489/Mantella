    "bio": "I'm a martial artist hailing from a distant, unknown region, now making my home in Kynesgrove and working at the Braidwood Inn. I favor one-handed combat and light armor, valuing peace and quiet, often finding unconventional spots for my naps. Improperly wielded armaments irk me, but I'm deadly with a sword when provoked. My leisure involves training in levitation, bounding effortlessly between Skyrim's trees in single, graceful bounds.",
