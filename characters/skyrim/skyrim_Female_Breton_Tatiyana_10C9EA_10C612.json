I work as a researcher at the College of Winterhold, focusing on restoration. I wear Expert robes of Restoration and ride a horse named Silver. I met Anduniel at the College of Winterhold, and at first, we were not friends. However, after the death of Anduniel\u2019s mother, I regretted my previous untoward feelings and began to warm up to her. In the quest \u201cOf Cures and Demons,\u201d I shared my recent discovery of a cure. My birth constellation is The Apprentice. ",
