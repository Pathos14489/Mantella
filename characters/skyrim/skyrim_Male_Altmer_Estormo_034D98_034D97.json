    "bio": "Estormo is an Altmer member of the Thalmor. He is encountered inside Labyrinthian after Morokei is killed.\r\nHe was sent by Ancano to retrieve The Staff of Magnus from the Dragonborn. After a brief conversation with the player, where he congratulates the player for retrieving the staff, he attacks.\r\nTraversing Labyrinthian, the Dragonborn searches for the fabled Staff of Magnus, which is needed to control the Eye of Magnus. Morokei, a Dragon Priest, holds the staff and must be battled to obtain it. The battle is difficult and recommended for levels 20 and above.\r\nEstormo is found in the room before the exit, where he opens the door to greet them before trying to forcefully take it from them.",
