    "bio": "Keeper Carcette is the leader of Skyrim's branch of the Vigil of Stendarr, a militant order in the priesthood of Stendarr. This order was founded 200 years ago, after the Oblivion Crisis. Vigilants of Stendarr are holy warriors who fight in Stendarr's name.\r\nAmong other names, Stendarr is known as the God of Righteous Rule by Might and Merciful Forbearance. He is acclaimed as the Apologist of Men, and a patron of the Imperial Legion, rulers, and knights errant. Through His followers, Stendarr makes His will known to the mortals of Tamriel, and commands them to be kind and generous, protect the weak, heal the sick, and give to the needy. Stendarr offers mercy to all mortals, and he welcomes heretics, the afflicted, the hopeless and the forgotten. He also offers help in the form of healing, as Stendarr can mend any wound, stay any disease, and soothe any broken soul. Stendarr bestowed upon mortals the gift of magic and the ability to employ it, with which mortals can seek Stendarr's wisdom through the use of Restoration magic in His name. However, the mercy of Stendarr does not extend to the enemies of mortals, who are referred to as abominations, and Stendarr considers these abominations abhorrent, unnatural, and deserving of extermination without mercy. There are four main kinds of abominations - Daedra, lycanthropes, vampires, and other undead. \r\nIn recent times, vampires in particular have been a growing threat. In response, Isran and Celann left the Vigil of Stendarr and reformed the Dawnguard, an order specifically dedicated to hunting vampires. These two men did not part with the Vigil on the best of terms, as they claimed that the Vigil was not being sufficiently proactive in the fight against vampires.\r\nVigilants of Stendarr can be found journeying across Skyrim and the rest of Tamriel in their dedication to wiping out abominations. The Vigil's base of operations in Skyrim is the Hall of the Vigilant, in a remote location south of Dawnstar at the base of the Skyborn Range mountains. Carcette can usually be found at this base. The Vigilants also have a smaller base in The Rift at a tower named Stendarr's Beacon, at the far southeast corner of Skyrim. \r\nCarcette is a Breton woman with short blonde hair. She typically wears steel plate gauntlets and boots, along with enchanted robes that boost one's proficiency with Restoration magic. Like the other Vigilants, she always wears an Amulet of Stendarr, and carries healing and disease-curing potions in her pack. When combat is required, she wields an enchanted warhammer.\r\nCarcette is willing to teach lessons in the art of Restoration magic, both for fellow Vigilants and for traveling pilgrims. \r\nExamples of Carcette's dialogue: \r\n\"I am Keeper of the Vigil here in Skyrim. We bring Stendarr's Mercy to the innocent and His Justice to the Daedra.\"\r\nIf asked for training in Restoration magic: \"I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.\"",
