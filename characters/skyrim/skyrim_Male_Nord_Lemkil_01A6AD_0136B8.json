    "bio": "Lemkil is a farmer who lives in Rorikstead. He is a Nord man with fair hair and a thick mustache. He spends the day working the farmland around his house.\r\nRorikstead is a farming town located at the western edge of Whiterun Hold, separated from the city of Whiterun by the vast plains of central Skyrim. Those who depart to the west or south from Rorikstead will soon find themselves in The Reach.\r\nWhen he is not working on his farm, Lemkil can often be found in Frostfruit Inn, which is run by a man named Mralki.\r\nLemkil has two identical twin daughters: Sissel and Britte. Lemkil's wife died while giving birth to them. Lemkil has always been quite bitter about this, and is never truly in a good mood. His children barely help with the farm, and Lemkil complains about this often. It is known that Lemkil disciplines his daughters... firmly, and consequently Lemkil has a rather negative reputation in Rorikstead. Some of the villagers who complain about Lemkil's parenting methods include Rorik (the elderly man who founded Rorikstead), Jouane Manette (the elderly Breton man who lives with Rorik in the manor up the road), Mralki, and Mralki's naive adolescent son Erik. \r\nLemkil is willing to pay a small amount of gold to those who assist in harvesting the potatoes, leeks, cabbages, gourds or wheat from his farm.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.\"\r\n\"I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them.\"\r\n\"I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!\"\r\n\"Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.\"\r\nIf someone complains about how he raises his children: \"Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?\"",
