    "bio": "Synda Llanith, a Dunmer woman, is a farmer who lives with her husband Dravin at the Merryfair Farm, near Riften.\r\nThey make a living growing wheat, cabbage and gourds. They also have a cow and chickens. Synda tends the garden and is willing to pay people to help harvest its produce.\r\nIf the player returns Dravin's bow to him, she will be grateful for the improvement in her husband\u2019s mood.\r\nShe worries about her husband, and is particularly worried that his attitude towards the Riften guards will get him in trouble. \r\nHer husband berates her if she forgets to bring her dagger for self-defense when she walks on the road to Riften.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place.\"\r\n\"I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.\"\r\n\"You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.\"\r\n\"The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.\"\r\n\"Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected.\"",
