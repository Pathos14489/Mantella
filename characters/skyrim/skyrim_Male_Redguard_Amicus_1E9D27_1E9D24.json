    "bio": "Addicted to dreaming, Amicus has difficulties staying connected to the real world. Amicus is initially encountered sleeping in one of the beds in Haelga\u2019s Bunkhouse in Riften. Upon being awoken, he will initially assume the player is Haelga pestering him and will display annoyance. Once he realizes that a stranger has disturbed him, he will compose himself and explain that he spends most of his life sleeping, as he\u2019s addicted to his particularly vivid dreams, which are situation in which he really feels alive. This lifestyle is not without its drawbacks however, as he now rarely washes, barely eats, and steals to fund his lifestyle. A prolific but light sleeper, he considers the amount of noise at the Bunkhouse and how any disturbance or measure of awareness breaks his dream, which is unrepeatable.",
