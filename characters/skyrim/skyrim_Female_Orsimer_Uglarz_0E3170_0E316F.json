She left the Orc stronghold of Narzulbur many years ago, and has been living self-sufficiently in the woods of Eastmarch ever since. She is extremely good at hunting. She is open to potentially returning to Narzulbur.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I am Uglarz, huntress of all.\"\r\n\"Narzulbur was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time. I may go back there some day.\"",
