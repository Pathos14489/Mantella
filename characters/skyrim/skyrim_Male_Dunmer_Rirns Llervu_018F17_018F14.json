    "bio": "Rirns Llervu, a Dunmer, is a beggar who is originally encountered at the Earth Stone outside Raven Rock. He was forced to constantly work on the structure, until the player (who is the Dragonborn) freed him and the others from their mental enslavement.\r\nOnce freed from the indoctrination, he remarks \"I'm asking myself why Miraak was making us build these shrines... and I'm afraid the answer will be far worse than any of us can imagine.\" and return to the abandoned building in Raven Rock with Bralsa Drel.\r\nIf the ebony mines are reopened, he will find a job working there and will remark \"Bralsa's been nice enough to show me how to swing a pickaxe. She is an old hat when it comes to digging up ebony. I may not be an expert at it yet, but it's good to be back to work and have some coin in my pockets.\"",
