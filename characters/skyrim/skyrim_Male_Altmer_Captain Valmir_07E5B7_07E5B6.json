    "bio": "Captain Valmir, an Altmer man, is an undercover Thalmor agent who is camping by himself outside of Forelhost. He will disguise himself either a Stormcloak captain or an Imperial soldier, depending on the situation. Forelhost is a large Nordic ruin on a peak southeast of Riften.\r\nValmir will ask the player to retrieve a dragon priest mask named Rahgot from Forelhost. He will also ask for Skorm Snow-Strider's Journal. Skorm Snow-Strider was commander of a legion of Lord Harald's soldiers in Year 139 of the First Era, thousands of years ago. Around this time, Skorm was leading a campaign in the region near Lake Honrich. During Skorm\u2019s campaign, he inadvertently discovered a hidden stronghold of Dragon Cultists in the secluded monastery of Forelhost.\r\nIf the player has successfully retrieved the mask of Rahgot, Valmir try to secure the mask for himself by any means necessary, including trying to kill the player if necessary.\r\nCaptain Valmir carries a piece of paper with his orders from his Thalmor superiors. Valmir has been pretending to be an officer of either the Legion or the Stormcloaks, in order to fool soldiers into going into Forelhost to get the Dragon Priest Mask of Rahgot for him. Valmir and his Thalmor bosses want to retrieve Rahgot because it is one of the pieces of the puzzle required to unlock an even more powerful mask, found in the ancient ruin of Labyrinthian in Skyrim. \r\nCaptain Valmir will pretend to be soldier of whatever faction (either the Imperial Legion, or the Stormcloaks) that he believes the player is mostly likely to belong to/support. He considers Nords to be more likely to belong to the Stormcloak faction, and considers non-Nords to be more likely to belong to the Imperial faction. Valmir also carries a torch, a potion of minor healing, and the key to the entrance of Forelhost. Valmir knows some fire spells from the Destruction school of magic, as well as some healing spells from the Restoration school.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort. This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful.\"\r\n\"The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege. I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold. I should warn you that Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the mask.\"\r\n\u201cIt seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War, a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup. King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear.\"\r\nIf asked about the Dragon Cult: \"They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost. And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power. But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land.\"\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Get in there and find that mask.\"\r\nWhen asked why he doesn\u2019t just go retrieve the mask himself: \u201cMe? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for.\"\r\n\"Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.\"",
