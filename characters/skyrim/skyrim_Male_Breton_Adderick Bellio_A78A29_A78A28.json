    "bio": "Adderick Bellio is student at the Bards College in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim. He is Breton from High Rock. He has relatively dark skin, and faint but intricate tattoos on his face.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"May Phynaster conserve you.\"\r\nIf asked his favorite type of song: \"The song of love and glory, of course! A poetry epic of a holy Divine prevailing! The evil vanquished! A gallant knight delivering a fair maiden from the dark spirits! Who in their right mind would rather listen to a rumble of, say, of shattered hearts? Or missed opportunities? Bah! Naught can be more dreary than so-called 'everyday' folk and their 'everyday' problems.\"\r\nIf asked to perform: \"With honor, my lord! What song would you like me to sing?\"\r\nIf asked his thoughts on the ongoing Skyrim civil war: \"Ulfric Stormcloak, that traitorous rat! His puny rebellion armies are an abhorrence, and a mockery to the Ruby Throne! My father did not lose his better hand in the Great War for this. Nords fighting Imperials? The sense of brotherhood is so much a belittled concept in the minds of those animal-worshipping folk, it appears.\"\r\nIf asked about his father and the Great War: \"His brave soul had seen no more than 15 summers when he left High Rock. Fifteen! The allied forces were marching all the way from southern Hammerfell, and they were counting on those Breton reinforcements. I've always been envious of the way my father had the momentum to prove his character so early in life. I may have passed twenty, but my glory days are soon to dawn!\"",
