    "bio": "She will initially welcome the Dragonborn to the skooma den hidden under Redwater Den. When asked about the den, she boasts that they are purveyors of the best Skooma outside of Balmora. If asked what is so special about the Skooma, she explains that the secret is the Bloodspring located deep within the den.\r\nShe can be persuaded to give a free sample of Redwater Skooma or it can be bought from her.\r\nHowever, once the Dragonborn opens the gate or drinks the Redwater Skooma, she becomes hostile and attacks with her bows, as will the Attendant, the Doorman, and the Redwater Lookouts should one return via the front door of the den to Skyrim's overworld.\r\nAfter discovering the Bloodspring, she will be the sole inhabitant of the den not marked as a Vampire's Thrall provided she is still alive, but will not be there on later visits back to the den, such as during radiant quests for the Volkihar Clan.",
