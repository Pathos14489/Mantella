    "bio": "Arniel's Shade is the ghost of the College of Winterhold mage Arniel Gane, who was destroyed or possibly transported to another plane of reality. The player witnessed this unexpected occurrence.\r\nThe spirit appears just as Gane himself did the last time the player saw him in person, except that the robes he's wearing include a hood. He is summoned by a two-handed Conjuration spell that requires no Magicka, and he remains with the player as an ally for sixty seconds. The ghost will engage any nearby enemies (including dragons), and he moves aggressively around the combat area attacking with a continuous lightning stream that appears to be a stronger version of the Sparks spell: it may be true that this is the only method of attack he makes use of.\r\nArniel's Shade, from the time he is summoned to the time he vanishes, certainly appears to be beyond injury of any kind, and elsewhere this has been attributed to his ghostly nature. It's possible that he has never been observed on his hands and knees in a nearly incapacitated state, as has been the case with numerous other followers over time; furthermore, it is also possible that he has never been dispatched by an opponent before the spell's sixty seconds of time has expired. However, when not in combat and following the player Arniel's Shade can be heard gasping or perhaps retching from time to time, as if in pain or suffering.\r\nHowever, while the player can't interact with the ghost, the ghost will periodically speak to the player.",
