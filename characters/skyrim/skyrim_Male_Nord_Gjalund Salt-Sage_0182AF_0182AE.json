    "bio": "Gjalund Salt-Sage is the captain of the Northern Maiden and can be found in Windhelm Docks aboard his ship. \r\nGjalund is found in Windhelm Docks and brings the Dragonborn to Solstheim. \r\nAt first, he says that he does not want to go back to Solstheim. He cannot remember how he sailed to Windhelm and he cannot remember anything from the whole journey. This is the reason why he does not want to go back. He can be bribed, intimidated or persuaded to bring the Dragonborn to Solstheim. \r\nAfter the first trip to Solstheim, Gjalund will charge the Dragonborn 250 gold for each consecutive trip. However, this can be bypassed by using the fast travel arrow on the corner of Solstheim's and Skyrim's world map to alternatively traverse the two regions. \r\nAre you the captain of the Northern Maiden? \"Sure. Yeah. That's me. Why? Who sent you?\"",
