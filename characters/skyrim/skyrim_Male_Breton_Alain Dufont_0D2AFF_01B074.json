    "bio": "Alain Dufont is a Breton man with blue eyes and brown hair. He is the leader of a bandit group which resides in the Dwemer ruin of Raldbthar, located at the southeastern edge of The Pale.\r\nAt some point, he heard about the murder of Friga Shatter-Shield and headed to the city of Windhelm in Eastmarch Hold, hoping to swindle money from Friga's relatives. At Candlehearth Hall (a popular inn) in Windhelm, he met a young Breton woman named Muiri. Wanting to exploit Muiri's connections to the Shatter-Shield family, he romanced her. He then robbed the Shatter-Shields, who blamed the event on Muiri. After the deed was done, Alain left Muiri and went into hiding in the Dwemer ruins of Raldbthar.\r\nHe wields Aegisbane, a unique enchanted warhammer which he stole from the Shatter-Shield family.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Well, you must have all of those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit that's pretty impressive.\"",
