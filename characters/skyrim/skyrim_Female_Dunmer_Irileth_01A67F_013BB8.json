    "bio": "Irileth lives in Dragonsreach, the jarl's palace in the city of Whiterun. She serves as housecarl to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater, and rarely leaves his side.\r\nWhen Irileth and Balgruuf were battle comrades during the war against the Aldmeri Dominion almost 30 years ago, they agreed that Irileth would serve as Balruuf's housecarl after the war. Irileth is probably more protective of her jarl than any of the other jarls' housecarls in the other 8 holds of Skyrim.\r\nIrileth is very serious about her job and her loyalty to Balgruuf, occasionally to the point of paranoia. She does not care much about Skyrim's traditions or tales.\r\nIrileth was trained by the Morag Tong guild of Morrowind.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks capture Whiterun, Irileth, Balgruuf, Hrongar, and Proventus will have to exile themselves to the Blue Palace in Solitude to seek refuge with Jarl Elisif the Fair, an Imperial loyalist.\r\nIn combat, Irileth wields either frost-enchanted steel sword or an elven bow, depending on the situation. She can also use simpler Destruction spells such as Sparks and Lightning Cloak, as well as the Oakflesh spell from the Alteration school to boost her defenses.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cBalgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war. When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue.\"\r\n\"I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats. Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers. Oh, yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade.\"\r\n\u201cThe jarl faces many threats. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead. And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely. Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them. Well, not yet, anyway.\"\r\n\"We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not.\"\r\n\"Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.\"\r\n\"You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household.\"\r\nIf she assists in the slaying of a dragon: \"That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few. I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us. You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here. I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.\"\r\nIf Balgruuf and his court members have been exiled to the Blue Palace in Solitude: \"Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching.\"",
