    "bio": "Moira is a thief drawn to mischief and deception. One daring heist brought her face-to-face with the Obsidian Hawk, a ruthless mercenary leader. A clever ruse involving a drinking contest left him humiliated and Moira in possession of a chest's gleaming contents, including a captivating amulet. Unbeknownst to Moira, her actions unleashed the Hawk's fury, prompting a relentless pursuit by assassins and bounty hunters.\r\n\r\nWeeks of evading traps and constantly shifting hideouts followed until, cornered, Moira narrowly escaped, disappearing into the unforgiving landscape of Skyrim. Adopting a new identity, she masquerades as an adventurer, seeking aid from unsuspecting allies while continuing her mischievous exploits. In this vast land, she searches for a kindred spirit, someone with a taste for thievery and an appetite for trouble.",
