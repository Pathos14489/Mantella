    "bio": "Astrid is the leader of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim and wife of another Dark Brotherhood member named Arnbjorn. She resides in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, near Falkreath, and holds the responsibility of finding new recruits for the Dark Brotherhood in the Night Mother's absence. She has shoulder-length blonde hair.\r\nWhen asked about her past, Astrid says that she had an uncle who made \"unwanted advances\" towards her, so she killed him. It \"felt good, really good,\" so she killed another, unspecified person, and it \"felt even better.\" At some point, she joined the Dark Brotherhood and later married another Brotherhood member, Arnbjorn. Her husband Arnbjorn is a werewolf.\r\nAstrid decrees her authoritarian leadership to be \"stronger\" than The Five Tenets of the Dark Brotherhood. She tires of the laws and restrictions that limit the Brotherhood, deciding that a sort of family-like unity benefits the members of the Brotherhood better than rigid structure. If the Night Mother arrives at the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary and Astrid discovers that the player is the new Listener, Astrid will feel that her leadership is threatened and eventually betray the player.\r\nWhen in the Abandoned Shack, if the player kills one or more of the three hostages, Astrid will gave the player directions to the Sanctuary, as well as the password to get past The Black Door guarding the Sanctuary (the password is \u201cSilence, my brother\u201d), and will invite them to join her \"family.\"\r\nOnce the player has arrived at the Dark Brotherhood, Astrid will direct them to speak to Nazir for side contracts the Dark Brotherhood has received.\r\nAstrid may ask the player to spy on Cicero, as she suspects that he is plotting with another member of the sanctuary to destroy the Brotherhood.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\u201cThis Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it 'aptitude' for elimination. I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on. I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are.\"\r\nIf the player has killed one or more of the hostages in the Abandoned Shack: \u201cI would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood. In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view. When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: \"Silence, my brother.\" Then you're in. And your new life begins. I'll see you at home.\"",
