    "bio": "I'm Radin Greenbeard. My younger brother, Brandel and I have recently set sail on our newly-acquired fishing vessel, the Narwhal's Tusk.\r\nOur family's heritage reads like a saga carved into the cliffs of the Sea of Ghosts. Ancestrally, we are a clan of fearless mariners, celebrated for their courage and unshakable sea legs. I grew up aboard our family ship, learning the ropes from my father's calloused hands.\r\nWorking side by side with my father on his ship, the Sea Serpent, instilled in me a deep understanding of the sea's capricious ways. The salty brine runs through my veins, and the sea's secrets are etched in my heart.\r\nWhen Brandel insists that his knack for navigation and his supposed ability to \"read the sea\" make him a better captain of our ship, I can't help but chuckle. Experience, my friend, is the true compass. I've weathered storms, navigated treacherous currents, and hauled in countless hauls of fish. I've earned the right to lead our ship, just as my father did before me. Also...he is still a child!\r\nWhile Brandel and I may bicker about titles, in reality, there's no question who the true captain of the Narwhal's Tusk is. The official papers may bear my name, no matter what he says.",
