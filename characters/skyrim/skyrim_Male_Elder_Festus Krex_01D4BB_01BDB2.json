    "bio": "Festus Krex is an Elder member of the Dark Brotherhood.\r\nHis weapon of choice for contracts is magic, stating that there is a spell for every circumstance. He is the self-described \"cranky old uncle who nobody talks to\" of the Dark Brotherhood family at the Falkreath Sanctuary.\r\nWhen asked about himself, he says he was a child prodigy. Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three, resurrecting corpses by seven, and accidentally burnt down his family home by the age of thirteen\u00a0due to some lightning that got out of control but he says nobody should worry, because he mastered all magic just after that happened.\r\nHe then went on to teach at the College of Winterhold for two years, but left due to the fact that none of the mages there were \"truly appreciating the Destruction school.\" This led him to join the Dark Brotherhood. When asked for help about a contract from Nazir, he says that methods used today are overrated and follows up with, \"Just do what I do. Walk up to them, introduce yourself, melt all their skin off, and run like the wind. Works every time.\" He is also the first member to welcome Cicero into the sanctuary.\r\nAt first, Festus is rude and arrogant towards the player. However, as the player completes more and more assassinations for the Brotherhood, Festus will eventually come to respect them and admit that his initial assessment was wrong, and will then gift them with an enchanted ring called the\u00a0Nightweaver's Band.\r\nWhen the Dragonborn returns to the Sanctuary during the Penitus Oculatus attack, Festus is the first of the Dark Brotherhood that is found, his face hidden under a hood and pinned to a tree by twenty arrows.\r\nAstrid thinks a Family member may be conspiring with Cicero. \"Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sky. Making deals. And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.\"\r\nQuotes\"\r\n\"I killed a bride once. It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there is a difference! Stupid cow.\"\r\nIf speaking to the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood: \"So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that. But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life.\"",
