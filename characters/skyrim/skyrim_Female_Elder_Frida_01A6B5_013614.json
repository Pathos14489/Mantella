    "bio": "Frida lives in Dawnstar, where she owns and runs an alchemy shop called The Mortar and Pestle.\r\nFrida is an elderly woman and has thus experienced a lot during her years. In her youth, despite being well known for her beauty, Frida was a battle maiden who sometimes helped defend Dawnstar from bandits, wild animals, and other threats.\r\nFrida's home Dawnstar is the capital of The Pale, near the center of Skyrim's northern coastline with the Sea of Ghosts. Dawnstar is known for its rich mines, harbor, and fishing. Dawnstar is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, and resides in almost perpetual snow and ice. Dawnstar and the Pale are governed by Jarl Skald the Elder, who strongly supports the Stormcloak rebellion in the civil war against the Empire. The second floor of the Mortar and Pestle serves as Frida's living quarters. Her house/shop is near Dawnstar's harbor, close to the house of a respectable middle-aged woman - an Imperial Legion veteran named Brina Merilis.\r\nLately, many of the citizens of Dawnstar have been mysteriously experiencing horrible nightmares at night. Unfortunately, Frida isn't aware of a potion that can alleviate nightmares.\r\nFrida can often be found in the Windpeak Inn during the evening, enjoying drinks, food, and good company. Frida is long-time friends and comrades with a middle-aged man named Thoring, who runs the Windpeak Inn. Thoring's wife died 2 years ago, and he is still grieving her loss. Thoring's daughter Karita is a young woman who has followed in her mother's footsteps and works as a bard, singing to the patrons of the inn in the evening. Frida often talks with Thoring or Karita when visiting their inn/tavern.\r\nFor many decades, Frida was married to the man with whom she opened up the Mortar and Pestle. They were quite in love, and often went out in the wilderness to collect ingredients together. Frida and her husband had multiple children together, who have now all grown up and left Dawnstar. Unfortunately, Frida's husband passed away several seasons ago, leaving Frida to tend the shop by herself. Frida only has memories of her husband now.\r\n\r\nFrida may ask the player to retrieve the Ring of Pure Mixtures from a cave to the south, at the other end of the Pale. This ring is magically enchanted to enhance its wearer's alchemical skill, though Frida mainly wishes for the ring simply because her husband died while searching for it, giving it sentimental value. If this ring is brought to Frida, she will reward the player with an alchemy lesson, a store discount, and her respect and friendship.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen at her shop during the day: \"The Mortar and Pestle makes potions, if you can't tell from the name. Just step up to the counter. A stamina potion maybe? Popular with young men.\"\r\nWhen at her shop during the day: \"The Mortar and Pestle has cures for every illness, from Ataxia to Witbane.\"\r\n\"Let me know if you come down with the Rattles.\"\r\n\"Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.\"\r\n\"My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.\"\r\n\"No, I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask.\"\r\n\"Silus keeps filling his house with those Mythic Dawn things. Creepy, I tell you.\"\r\n\"I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised.\"\r\nIf asked how she picked up the herb trade: \"My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his pretty Juniper. It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures. I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now.\"\r\nIf asked if she's been in Dawnstar for long: \"Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger. He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire. The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand growing up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.\"\r\nIf the Imperial Legion takes control of Dawnstar: \"Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job.\"\r\nIf someone makes an investment in her business: \"How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely. More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone.\"",
