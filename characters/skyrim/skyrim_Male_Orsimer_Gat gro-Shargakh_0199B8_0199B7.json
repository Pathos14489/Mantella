    "bio": "Gat Gro-Shargakh is an Orsimer who lives in Kolskeggr Mine, east of Markarth. He becomes a candidate for marriage.\r\n\r\nIf married, Gat will open a shop as other potential spouses do, from which the player can receive daily profits of 100 gold. If the profits are not collected, they accumulate and can be retrieved at any time. Be advised that even after clearing out the Forsworn, they can eventually respawn. This can result in Gat gro-Shargakh's death.\r\n\r\nIf Kolskeggr Mine is cleared and the Dragonborn is not allowed to enter Orc strongholds, he sends a message to notify them that the Dragonborn is trustworthy.",
