    "bio": "Rorik is a Nord landowner in Rorikstead. He is in charge of the village.\r\nRorik is a slightly gloomy man in his older years. He claims to have changed a lot for the worse since the war and that he has lost his charm years ago.\r\nRorik was a Legate in the Imperial Army during the Great War, in which he commanded a force of several dozen soldiers, most of which were from the Hold of Whiterun. Unfortunately, an Aldmeri soldier ran Rorik through with his blade during the battle, and left him to die. However, Rorik was saved by Jouane Manette, a Breton healer.\r\nAfter the war, he re-founded the settlement of Rorikstead. The town had existed since the First Era, when it was called Rorik's Steading, over a thousand years before Rorik was born. The settlement did not exist during the events of The Elder Scrolls: Arena in the Third Era.\r\nRorik, along with Jouane, resides in Rorik's Manor, the northernmost building in Rorikstead.\r\nRorik is a possible target needed to be intimidated by initiating a brawl.\r\nRorik is a possible target needed to be rescued from Redoran's Retreat.\r\nIs the town of Rorikstead named for you? \"Yes, that's right. Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine. Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion. Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.\"\r\nHas the war taken a toll on your settlement and its people? \"Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could. With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts. And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men. The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid.\"",
