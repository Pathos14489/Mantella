    "bio": "Kayle is the captain of a secret military unit of archers known as \"The Heartbow Rangers.\" Twenty years ago they traveled from Valenwood and began assisting various people in Skyrim. No one really knows what their goal is, but there are some politics involved. Years ago, Kayle took a recruit under her wing and trained her in the ways of The Heartbow.  This recruit was Solvi who turned out to be one of the most skilled archers in Skyrim. Kayle has all the skills Solvi has, but as her mentor she is stronger and has additional skills. Heartbow Rangers can be distinguished by the heart tattoo under their left eye. Kayle also has three circles indicating her rank within the unit.",
