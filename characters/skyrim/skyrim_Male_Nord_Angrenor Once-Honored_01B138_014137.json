    "bio": "Angrenor Once-Honored lives in Windhelm. Once a Stormcloak soldier fighting in the ongoing rebellion against the Imperial Legion, his service was cut short after he was severely wounded in battle. He is now a beggar on the streets of Windhelm.\r\nAngrenor is a proud Nord. He has short gray balding hair. He usually wears a tattered roughspun tunic, and simple footwraps. He carries his iron mace on his hip.\r\nIn the morning, he can usually be found at Candlehearth Hall. This popular tavern/inn a popular inn is run by a woman named Elda Early-Dawn, and is located near the city's front gate. Angrenor can also sometimes be found down in the Gray Quarter, the section of the city in which the jarl of Windhelm has decreed that all Dark Elves must reside.\r\nAngrenor holds deep prejudice and distrust against elves, particularly Dark Elves (Dunmer). He usually uses insulting terms such as \"gray-skin\" when referring to Dark Elves. When heckling passing Dark Elves, he is often joined by a fellow Nord named Rolff Stone-Fist. Here is an example of a potential verbal exchange between Angrenor, Rolff, and a passing Dark Elf who ventures out of the Gray Quarter:\r\nRolff: \"You come here where you're not wanted, you eat our food, you pollute our city with your stink and you refuse to help the Stormcloaks.\"\r\nDark Elf Woman: \"But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight!\"\r\nAngrenor: \"Hey, maybe the reason these gray-skins don't help in the war is because they're Imperial spies!\"\r\nDark Elf Woman: \"Imperial spies?! You can't be serious!\"\r\nRolff: \"Maybe we'll pay you a visit tonight, little spy. We got ways of finding out what you really are...\"\r\nDespite his gruff demeanor, if Angrenor is shown kindness and charity, he will likely quickly warm up to that person.\r\nAngrenor is an eligible bachelor. As per Nord custom, Angrenor will likely expect anyone asking for his hand in marriage to be wearing an amulet of Mara, to indicate their intention of finding a spouse.\r\nHere are some examples of Angrenor's potential dialogue towards strangers:\r\n\"I would be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war wound.\"\r\n\"I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest.\"\r\n\"Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though.\"\r\n\"I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol.\"\r\n\"The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.\"\r\n\"I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.\"\r\nIf he is encountered in the abandoned Aretino residence: What? Were you hoping to claim this house for yourself? Well, the Aretinos always liked me, so I think I'm family enough to take up here.\"\r\nIf he is given money: \"Oh thank you. Divines bless your kind heart.\"",
