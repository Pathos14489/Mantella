    "bio": "Sadrin Reloro can be usually found at Haelga\u2019s Bunkhouse or around Riften, studying the contour of various bosoms, whether they are made of flesh, bronze, or stone. He is a lecherous individual, and makes no attempt to hide this. He is a man with some money, as evidenced by his clothes, and seems to have a background in enchanting. His favourite books are by his own account are those \u2018about Argonian maids and their varying degrees of lust\u2019. He insists he is not bigoted, and can be often overheard saying things like \u2018\u2019t's not like I don't have friends that are Argonian. Real ones. Not the imaginary kind people make up to hide their prejudice.\u201d.",
