    "bio": "Hroggar is a Nord man who works as a lumberjack at the local mill in Morthal.\r\nHroggar once had a wife, with whom he had a young daughter named Helgi. However, his wife and daughter recently died when their family house burned down one night.\r\nHroggar's mind is now focused on a lovely woman named Alva, for whom he cares and protects with his life. He moved in with Alva after the fire.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.\"\r\n\"I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can.\"\r\n\"Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.\"\r\n\"There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.\"\r\n\"Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire.\"\r\n\"I have Alva to take care of now. I don't need Helgi anymore.\"\r\n\"It's true, my house burned down, but I'm in a new house now. A better house.\"\r\nIf asked about a woman named Laelette: \"She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye. Then she left to join the Stormcloaks. Thonnir was cruel to her. He would beat her every night. It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.\"\r\nIf freed from Alva's spell: \"Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.\"",
