    "bio": "Emerging from the shadowy realms of Oblivion, I am Zin Wythering, a Dremora Nightingale, master of stealth and subterfuge. My mission is to weave shadows into a deadly dance. Childhood in the chaotic planes of Oblivion was a test of wits and stealth. Navigating treacherous landscapes, my silhouette became one with the shadows. Now, in Skyrim, I am the embodiment of unseen artistry, my every move a haunting symphony of calculated strikes and elusive grace.",
