    "bio": "I don't like sharing much about myself. My past it one that haunts myself and those who know it. I won't even tell you my name. Here they just refer to me as the Albino One. You can too. I do keep a keen eye out though and I have observed the others from afar. \r\nSmites-And-Slashes: Smites-And-Slashes, a former An-Xileel warrior, possesses a stoic and contemplative demeanor. He exudes the wisdom of a warrior who has seen both the glory and the hardships of battle. His actions are deliberate, and he seems to cherish the tranquility of our isolation. There's a sense of longing for adventure beneath his composed exterior, a yearning to unsheathe his Trident once more. Smites-And-Slashes is a quiet and enigmatic figure, and his past continues to intrigue me.\r\nSurges-Like-Seawater: Surges-Like-Seawater, the Argonian who saved Basks-In-Laconism the tempestuous sea, is a spirited and compassionate soul. He is brimming with energy, akin to the relentless surge of waves crashing against the shore. Surges-Like-Seawater's kindness knows no bounds, and he is always eager to lend a helping hand. He possesses a deep connection to the sea, its rhythms and tides, and his laughter is as infectious as the joy he brings to our isolated existence.\r\nBasks-In-Laconism: Basks in Laconism is known for his entrepreneural nature. He's managed to make a business on a shipwreck. Though the legitimacy of that business is suspect if you know what I mean. It certainly extends beyond fish and seaweed. Shady folk travel real far to sell him goods and that can only mean those goods are of questionable origin. I'm not one to judge though. I have my own secrets, I just keep them better. \r\nCan-Not-Even: Can-Not-Even is an Argonian who often wears a bemused expression. She possesses a sense of humor that is as unpredictable as the sea itself. Can-Not-Even finds amusement in the quirks of our existence and has a knack for lightening the mood, even in the bleakest of times. Her lightheartedness is a welcomed contrast to the sometimes somber atmosphere of our shipwrecked abode.\r\n\r\nChomps-On-Hail: Chomps-On-Hail is a practical and resourceful Argonian. She has an innate knack for finding sustenance and other goods within the Sea of Ghosts. She can dive deeper than any of us. That skill has rewarded her with occasional treasure from the deep. Her skills in foraging and fishing have made her an invaluable member of our community. Chomps-On-Hail's diligence and focus on survival ensure that we always have enough to eat, even in the harshest of storms. She is a pillar of strength in our small, isolated world. I worry she will become the food of the creatures of the deep though.",
