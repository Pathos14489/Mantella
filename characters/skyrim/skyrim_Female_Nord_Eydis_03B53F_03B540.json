    "bio": "Eydis was a bandit who died in Fahlbtharz, a Dwarven ruin on the island of Solstheim. She was a Nord. Her corpse now lies to the left of the Fahlbtharz boiler room, on the edge. When she died, she was wearing a Skaal fur coat with matching boots and hat. She wielded an enchanted war axe. Next to her corpse is her journal. The last page of her journal reads as follows: \"I finally caved and told Ulyn that I would help him retrieve this 'Visage of Mzund' that he has been so obsessed over. Why he wants some dwarven helmet so much is beyond me, but I owe him so whatever. We've stopped to take a breather after crossing over the gears. This place is amazing but it seems to serve no purpose that I can tell. Why the dwarves would waste so much good metal on gears, pipes and constructs is completely beyond me. We had to fight off several of the metal spiders while spinning around on the gears. Got so dizzy we almost fell off.\"\r\nWhen Eydis and her associate, a Dark Elf named Ulyn, were attacked by metal spiders, Ulyn went further into the ruin while Eydis stayed back to hold them off. The metal spiders soon overwhelmed and killed her.",
