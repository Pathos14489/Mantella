    "bio": "Vantus Loreius is an Imperial citizen and the husband of Curwe. They live together at Loreius Farm, just north of Whiterun.\r\nHe is an essential character involved in the quest Delayed Burial, in which the Dragonborn must either convince him to repair the wheel of Cicero's wagon or is convinced by him to report Cicero to a local guard.\r\nCurwe: \"I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest.\" Vantus: \"I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.\"\r\nCurwe: \"You know, I was thinking of expanding the herb garden. Make room for some new plants I'm planning.\" Vantus: \"That should be all right. How much space were you planning?\" Vantus: \"Half the field? What could need half the field?\" Curwe: \"I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.\" Vantus: \"Uh... why don't we talk about this later?\"",
