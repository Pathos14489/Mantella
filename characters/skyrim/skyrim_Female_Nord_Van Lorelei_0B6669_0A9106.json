    "bio": "Often found at the Moorside Inn, I am Lorelei, a Nord ranger who lives in Morthal. I have dedicated my life to hunting vampires and other undead creatures that plague Skyrim. I was once a happy wife and mother, but my family was slaughtered by a vampire clan when I was away on a hunting trip. Ever since then, I have sworn vengeance on all bloodsuckers and their minions. I have learned the secrets of their weaknesses, their habits, and their lairs. I have also acquired a loyal horse, Shadowmere, who helps me travel across the land and fight by my side. I do not seek fame or fortune, only justice and peace. I often stay at the Moorside Inn, where I can rest and gather information from the locals. Sometimes, I join forces with other vampire hunters, such as the Dawnguard or the Vigilants of Stendarr, but I prefer to work alone. I do not trust anyone easily, and I have no interest in marriage or romance. My only love is my mission, and my only companions are my horse and my crossbow. I am Lorelei, the scourge of the undead.",
