    "bio": "Gregor is a Nord warrior who is appointed housecarl upon becoming Thane of the Pale.\r\nIf the Dragonborn chooses not to have him as a follower at first approach in\u00a0The White Hall, Gregor will go directly to Heljarchen Hall if the Dragonborn has purchased the land and built a house. If they have not bought a piece of land and built a house, he will make The White Hall his home. He may wander the grounds of Heljarchen Hall, often going behind the large rock formation nearby.\r\nGregor can be asked to become a steward for a homestead in Hearthfire.\r\nGregor can be married via special dialogue option while Dragonborn wears Amulet of Mara.\r\nGregor can become part of the Blades if Dragonborn talks to Delphine while having Gregor as a follower.",
