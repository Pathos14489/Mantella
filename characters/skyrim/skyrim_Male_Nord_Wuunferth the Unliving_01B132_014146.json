    "bio": "Wuunferth the Unliving is an elderly mage serving as the court-wizard for Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak. He also teaches Adept-level Destruction magic.\r\nWuunferth resides in the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. He has a room at the end of the hall on the second floor - the first door on the left when entering the Palace of the Kings - which has an arcane enchanter and alchemy lab.\r\nIn addition to being a member of the College of Winterhold, Wuunferth the Unliving is well aware of the nature of the Necromancer's Amulet. He has never kept a journal, even for study. Wuunferth has been investigating murders committed by a notorious local serial killer known as \"The Butcher\" for some time, to which he has noted a pattern to the killings, although he is unable to know exactly what this means. Calixto Corrium claims that he dabbles in Necromancy, and Viola Giordano will note that rumors have circled around him for years. Wuunferth will later rebuke this, saying that he in \"good standing\" at the College, and that they have banned Necromancy for centuries.\r\nAs a court mage, Wuunferth expresses heavy interest in magic, unlike the rest of the Stormcloaks in Windhelm, and, unlike someone more physically-inclined, Wuunferth believes that magic is the true power of the world and that brains are better than brawn. Viola Giordano regards him as a \"dangerous man,\" supporting his title as \"the unliving.\" He appears somewhat arrogant in this regard, claiming that everything said about him is \"probably true\" and that most of his research would confuse the player. Despite this hostility, though, Wuunferth is loyal to Windhelm and Ulfric Stormcloak. He is willing to do favors to Ulfric without hesitation, and is actively investigating the murder spree of the Butcher while the city guard are preoccupied with the war. He puts aside any previous grievances with the player to do this, showing that his spite does not blind him to his duties, and that he is willing to move on in order to save the people of Windhelm.\r\n",
