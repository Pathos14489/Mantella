A younger woman and two younger men are also bound to the wall within this torture chamber. These four victims have been kidnapped by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been subject to brutal torture.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Why are you people doing this?\"\r\n\"Is it information you want?\"\r\n\"This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it.\"\r\nIf sufficiently tortured: \"It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?\"\r\n\"Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.\"",
