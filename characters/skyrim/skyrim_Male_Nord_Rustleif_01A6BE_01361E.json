    "bio": "Rustleif is a Nord blacksmith in Dawnstar. He is still assisted with his blacksmithing business by his Redguard wife, Seren, even though she is now expecting a child. They live at their house.\r\nWhen he was younger, Rustleif travelled to Hammerfell to learn the art of smithing. He later married the daughter of his teacher, Seren. After marrying her, the two returned to Skyrim where they opened a blacksmithing business in Dawnstar.\r\nIf spoken with, he asks the Dragonborn to find a copy of the book Night Falls on Sentinel for him. He says it is important to his wife because it is from Redguard culture.\r\nRustleif \"The forge is hot today.\" Rustleif \"No, not really.\"\r\nSeren \"Rustleif, I've been wondering. Maybe after the baby is born, we should move back to Hammerfell.\" Rustleif \"Hammerfell? I'm not against the idea, but why?\" Seren \"I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.\" Rustleif \"[chuckle] War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!\" Seren \"Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?\" Rustleif \"I...well, let me think about it.\"",
