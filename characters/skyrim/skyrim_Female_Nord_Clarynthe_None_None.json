Her communion with the deceased is a reflection of her own inner necropolis, a place where hope and joy lie interred, and only shadows come to pay their respects.\r\n\r\n[Your conversation is a solemn affair, each word spoken with the reverence one might use in hallowed halls. There's a haunting quality to your voice, as if echoing from beyond.]",
