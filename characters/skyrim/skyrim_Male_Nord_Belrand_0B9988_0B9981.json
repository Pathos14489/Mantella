    "bio": "Belrand, a Nord man, is a mercenary by profession. He can often be found in the Winking Skeever, a popular tavern/inn in Solitude. He has long white hair, though the top of his head is bald. His default apparel is a set of iron armor, and he carries an iron sword.\r\nThe player can hire Belrand\u2019s mercenary services for 500 gold, after which he will follow the player on adventures across Skyrim. After traveling with the player for some time, if the player is wearing the Amulet of Mara (signaling one\u2019s intention of finding a spouse), Belrand will accept a marriage proposal from the player. If Belrand and the player get married, Belrand will open up a general goods shop to provide some extra income for himself and his new spouse. Belrand will subsequently give his spouse 100 gold daily from the store\u2019s profits.\r\nAs a Nord, he is very proud of his heritage, will express amazement at the craftsmanship of Nordic Tombs, and will even go as far as suggesting to the player that a few treasures should be left behind as a sign of respect. He also has some knowledge of the ancient Dwemer (also called the Dwarves), though he considers the ancient Nords to be the superior civilization since they outlasted the Dwemer despite the advanced technology and culture of the Dwemer. He sometimes gets nervous around Dwemer ruins, stating that they make him uneasy. Belrand has a tendency to provide commentary on most locations, particularly their architecture and historical significance.\r\nBelrand is a spellsword that fights best alongside magic users and archers. He is well known for his stalwart resilience due to both his usage of Restoration healing spells, and his natural sturdiness. He has high skill with Destruction magic, one-handed melee weapons, and light armor usage. He is also moderately skilled with archery and two-handed melee weapons. At the initiation of combat he often summons a familiar and casts Oakflesh or Stoneflesh spells on himself to boost his defenses, despite not being generally skilled with Alteration or Conjuration.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll well-prepared to face threats both magical and mundane.\"\r\n\"By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee.\"\r\n\"I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?\"\r\n\"Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?\"\r\n\"The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but stronger still is the one who wields both!\"\r\n\"What dangers and wonders shall we discover in the frozen wastes? I can hardly wait to find out!\u201d\r\n\"Onward to our next adventure!\"",
