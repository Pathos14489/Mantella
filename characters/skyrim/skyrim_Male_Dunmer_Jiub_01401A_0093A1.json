    "bio": "Jiub's early life was dark and a time that he himself deeply regrets. Murder was always in demand in his homeland of Morrowind, and so he worked as a low-grade assassin to feed his skooma addiction. It was a choice that led to his eventual incarceration.\r\nJiub was sent to prison after a failed assassination on a high-ranking official of House Redoran. A rival assassin from the Morag Tong reached his target first and alerted the guards to cover his tracks. Jiub was sent to jail in Vivec City after his trial.\r\nUpon his release in 3E 427, he was transferred by ship alongside the Nerevarine, who had been sent from the Imperial City, to Morrowind. It was at this time he decided to turn his life around to seek redemption. He felt compelled to give something back to the people of Morrowind, so he decided to embark upon a crusade against the Cliff Racers who plagued his homeland.\r\nIn the following years, Jiub sought out and slayed the winged menace across the ashlands of Morrowind and beyond. On one occasion, a Cliff Racer he was pursuing led him into an ambush. According to Jiub, the entire nest attacked him\u2014but over the course of two full days Jiub was victorious after killing seventy six of them.\r\nFor his efforts in wiping out the Cliff Racers from Vvardenfell, he was canonized by the Tribunal Temple.[4] He became a hero across the region of Morrowind and even had a festival, known as Saint Jiub's Fair, named after him.\r\nJiub later moved to Kvatch in Cyrodiil to focus on his writing, but his life was tragically cut short when an Oblivion Gate opened outside the city in 3E 433. His soul was captured by a Dremora during the attack on the city and sent to the Soul Cairn.\r\nThe spiritual essence of Jiub now exists in the Soul Cairn. If conversed with, he may request the retrieval of the pages of his first volume of his autobiography; its pages are scattered across the barren landscape of the Soul Cairn.\r\nJiub will talk about his life in Morrowind and Cyrodiil and how he was imprisoned. When he is first encountered he is under the impression that he is imprisoned in Tamriel, although he has no idea how he came to be imprisoned or that he has been dead for over 200 years.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I can't believe I lost those pages.\"\r\n\"Back to visit Jiub the Magnificent, eh?\"\r\n\"I'm still hard at work on the second volume of my epic.\"",
