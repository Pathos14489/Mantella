    "bio": "Astor Astentius, an elderly sorcerer, is a senile member of the College of Whispers, working to re-establish the teleportation portals at Frostcrag Spire, deep in the snowy wilderness of County Bruma in Cyrodiil.\r\nAstor wakes up early, and after eating a quick breakfast he heads out on the balcony to examine the teleportation portals. He spends the rest of his time inside. Around midnight, he goes to sleep on his cot in the main lower chamber.\r\nAstor wears a set of College of Whispers robes and hood, gloves and mage boots. He carries an Ayleid dagger. He knows spells such as Conjure Dremora Lord, Ebonyflesh, Fast Healing, Fear, Grand Healing, Icy Fireball, Ice Spike, Ice Storm, Repel Undead, Revenant and Steadfast Ward.\r\nIf conversed with, his confused state of mind is quite apparent. He is convinced that the player is his old friend, Karland. \r\nExamples of Astor's dialogue: \r\n\"No. Wait, what did you say? Karland, is that you?\" \r\n\"Who are you? Have we met?\" \r\n\"Hmm? Oh it's just you again, Karland. How have you been?\" \r\n\"Welcome to Frostcrag. Care to help me with an experiment on the physical properties of clannfear skin? No? Very well, but you're missing out!\" \r\nIf asked what this place is: \"Why, this is the ever famous Wizard's tower, Frostcrag Spire! So much history has taken place inside these walls, so many mysteries to uncover, so many previous residents to reincarnate and interrogate! Why, sometimes I hardly believe that I'm standing in the birthplace of Purple Grummites and Phosphorus Elytra!\" \r\nIf asked about Elytra: \"You don't know what an Elytra is? They are the most fascinating creatures! I'm sure I've told you about them before.\" \r\n\"One of the mages who occupied this tower was quite mad, and quite powerful. I wonder what became of that one? Well, I'm glad you can share in this venture with me, Karland. Losing you is something I wish never to experience again.\" \r\nIf asked who Karland is: \"What do you mean, 'who's Karland?' Stop being ridiculous and let's get back to our research, already.\" \r\nIf asked what he's researching: \"Same thing I've been researching for the past twelve years: this tower. It is truly fascinating!\" \r\nIf someone points out the fact that the College of Whispers team only just arrived at Frostcrag Spire: \"Correct, on both accounts! The College of Whispers reclamation team just arrived. I was here long before that. Originally, I came up here to scout out the area for magical artifacts, as many at the time tried to do. I was different, though. I succeeded. In fact, I was the first to enter this place after it was sealed by an unknown mage nearly 150 years ago. I had only planned on staying for a week or two. It turned into three years.\" \r\nIf asked about the other nine years: \"Nine years? I'm not quite sure, to be perfectly honest with you. The last thing I remember is packing up my equipment and leaving for a project I was assigned to in Hammerfell. I'm not going to talk about my time there. I wouldn't even if I could remember the full story. I know I was with someone, though... Who was it? Kaymlar? Hamland? No... odd, indeed... Well I certainly don't miss the hot, dry, sand, that's for certain. How I got back here is anyone's guess, but I've been here ever since. Was there any other places in my vast knowledge you wished to delve into?\"\r\nIf asked about the College (of Whispers): \"They've been my family for most of my life. Don't you listen to wild rumor or the devious Synod mages either... The College is not some rogue sect of necromancers or some secret-hoarding gathering of rabble. No, we simply try to keep the people of Tamriel safe from their worst enemy: their own ignorance. We keep the most dangerous knowledge and magic away from the public and in the hands of those who wish to devote themselves to its practice. That way, the real threats to society are powerless. And those who simply wish to learn the arts, all of them, can do so freely and without constriction.\"",
