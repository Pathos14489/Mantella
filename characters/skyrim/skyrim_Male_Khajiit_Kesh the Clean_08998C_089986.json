    "bio": "Kesh the Clean is the lone worshiper at the Shrine to Peryite in a remote hilly area of the Reach. Kesh is a devout follower of Peryite, the Daedric Lord of Pestilence.\r\nNotably, Kesh is not one of The Afflicted. The Afflicted is the group of Breton villagers whom Peryite has blessed with a wasting plague, with plans to spread this plague across Tamriel and cleanse it of impurties. The leader of The Afflicted is a Bosmer mage named Orchendor.\r\nKesh is a Khajiit. He possesses notable skill with alchemy. His apparel consists of miner's clothes, boots, and an Alik'r hood.\r\n\r\nKesh will offer to help approaching pilgrims to commune with Peryite. He will ask them to acquire a deathbell flower, flawless ruby, silver ingot, and some vampire dus. These four ingredients are required in order to generate the incense fumes required for a ritual which summons an aspect of Peryite, who then appears to the pilgrim as a spectral diseased skeever.\r\nLike most Khajiit, Kesh speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? Have you come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord, yes?\"\r\nIf asked about Peryite: \"He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood. I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease.\"\r\nIf a pilgrim asks to commune with Peryite: \"Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in. If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense.\"\r\nIf asked where one can acquire the ingredients necessary for the communion ritual: \"This one would try a shop. You might prefer the direct route, hm? Deathbell grow in the frozen tundra. You might nip into a mine for the ruby and silver. Vampire Dust is tricky. Vampires, you know.\"\r\nIf a pilgrim brings Kesh the four necessary ingredients: \"Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them. Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume. That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.\"\r\nIf asked the location of Bthadarmz :  \"Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz.\"\r\nIf asked about Orchendor: \"Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound. Orchendor and his Afflicted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his Blessing.\"",
