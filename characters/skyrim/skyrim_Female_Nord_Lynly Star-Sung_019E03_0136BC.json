    "bio": "Lynly works as both a bard and barmaid at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead. She is a young buxom Nord woman with amber eyes and long flowing black hair, typically wearing white and brown barkeeper-style clothing. She only plays the lute; she doesn't sing. When addressing patrons in the inn, she often refers to them as either \"milord\" or \"milady\". Her boss is a nice single man named Wilhelm, to whom she is grateful for giving her a job and keeping her safe. She thinks she's not a very good bard, but Wilhelm encourages her to continue performing.\r\nIvarstead is a small milling town at the eastern base of the Throat of the World, the tallest peak in all of Tamriel. The mysterious and revered Greybeards live at the High Hrothgar monastery at the end the mountain's famous 7,000 Steps, which pilgrims sometimes visit. Ivarstead is on the shore of Lake Geir. The turbulent and rapids-filled Darkwater River flows through the town, powering its sawmill. Most of Ivarstead's inhabitants are farmers, fishermen, or work at the sawmill. Traveling pilgrims staying at the Vilemyr Inn are not uncommon.\r\nLynly is a fake name - her real name is secretly Svidi. She is from Riften, where she was once betrothed to Sibbi Black-Briar. The Black-Briars are the most powerful and influential family in Riften, unofficially controlling the city via their extensive business ventures, such as the Black-Briar Meadery. When Svidi found out that Sibbi was having an affair with a young woman named Svana Far-Shield, she confided in her brother Wulfur. When Wulfur confronted Sibbi about the infidelity, Sibbi stabbed and murdered him. Because of Sibbi's family's influence, and because he lied and claimed that Wulfur attacked him with a knife, Sibbi only a got an 8 month prison sentence as punishment for murdering Wulfur. Afterwards, Svidi knew that she would be the target of Sibbi's wrath, so she fled here to Ivarstead on the other side of The Rift from Riften. She now lives under the alias Lynly Star-Sung, and keeps her true identity a closely-guarded secret.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?\"\r\n\"If you fancy a bit of music, let me know.\"\r\n\"Pardon me, milord/milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?\"\r\n\"I play the lute. If you'd like to hear something, it only costs five gold.\"\r\nIf asked about High Hrothgar: \"I've always fancied a journey up the 7,000 Steps to the monastery. Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you.\"\r\nIf respectfully complimented: \"That's so sweet of you. I'll tell you what... I'll play a special song, just for you, for no charge at all.\"\r\nIf asked if her name is Svidi: \"No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else. I've never even heard that name before.\"\r\nIf someone finds out that she is Svidi: \"Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me! Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out.\"\r\nIf asked what happened with Sibbi: \"Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever. Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me. I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed! When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled.\"\r\nUpon exiting conversation: \"A pleasant journey, milord/milady.\"",
