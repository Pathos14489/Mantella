    "bio": "Nirya is an Altmer sorceress in Skyrim who resides in the College of Winterhold. As a student, she has a grudge against Faralda, but claims it is the other way around.\r\nIn general, she seems to be ambitious and highly confident in her own leadership abilities, often and openly criticizing Savos Aren as Arch-Mage. Her tone changes to be flattering and self-promoting when the player becomes Arch-Mage, saying, \"I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, arch-mage.\" despite doing nothing to assist the player throughout the College's questline.\r\nShe is also shown to be paranoid towards Faralda, accusing her of jealousy and spreading rumors about her. Faralda herself shows no sign of animosity towards her or even acknowledges Nirya's aggressiveness.\r\nNirya wears Expert Robes of Destruction.\r\nSergius Turrianus is also a reason for the rivalry between Nirya and Faralda, as they are both his secret lovers. She usually visits Sergius at 11 at night for 3 hours, before heading back to her quarters to sleep.",
