    "bio": "Fruki is a Nord miner in Skyrim who works in the Quicksilver Mine in Dawnstar. She lives in her house, adjacent to the mine. Like most of the townspeople, she is plagued by terrible nightmares from Vaermina.\r\nFruki: \"Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur.\" Erandur: \"Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal.\" Irgnir: \"It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!\" Fruki: \"Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen.\" Erandur: \"Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares. In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara.\"\r\nIrgnir: \"You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.\" Fruki: \"Leigelf is a good man, and I'm not running out on him now.\" Fruki: \"No, not that it's any of your business.\"\r\nIrgnir: \"Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.\" Fruki: \"You're just getting older.\"",
