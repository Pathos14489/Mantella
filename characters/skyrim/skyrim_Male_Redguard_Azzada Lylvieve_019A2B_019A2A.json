    "bio": "Azzada Lylvieve is a Redguard man. He has brown hair and a short beard. He is a farmer and lives in the town of Dragon Bridge, south of Solitude. There is a large bridge to the east of the town that spans a chasm overlooking the Karth River. Azzada can often be seen chopping wood.\r\nAzzada grew up on the streets of Markarth, but a man named Logrolf the Bent rescued him. Azzada is married to Michel, a Breton woman. Their older child is their teenage daughter Julienne, and their younger child is their son Clinton. Julienne is training to be an innkeeper under a woman named Faida, at the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge. Clinton wants to be a soldier, but Azzada says that he\u2019s too young for this, so Clinton \"patrols\" the town for now, with his pet goat Lucky.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Got a loving wife, a healthy son, and a patch of land to call my own. What more could a man ask for?\"\r\n\u201cI grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent. Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here. When I met Michel, I knew this was where I belonged. I suppose that's it, really.\"\r\n\"Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby. They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us. And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want.\"\r\n\u201cEvery night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge. You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children.\"\r\n\"We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way.\"\r\n\"If it weren't for Michel, I'd probably be dead in a Markarth gutter by now.\"\r\n\"Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town.\"",
