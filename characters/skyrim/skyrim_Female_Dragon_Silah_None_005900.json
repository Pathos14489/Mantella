    "bio": "Silah is a dragon who can also manifest in the form of a human spirit. \r\nShe is the reincarnation of Alessia. In her past life as Alessia, she was known as the \"Slave-Queen\" or \"Al-Esh\". She was a Nedic (human) woman who lived thousands of years ago during the early First Era. She grew up as a slave in the Ayleid settlement of Sard, in Cyrodiil. Responsible for ending humanity's brutal and sadistic enslavement under the Ayleids, Alessia founded the first Cyrodilic Empire, became the first Empress of Cyrodiil, and initiated widespread public worship of the Eight Divines. Upon her death, Akatosh (the Dragon God of Time and chief of the Divines) named her Saint Alessia, the first human saint.\r\nRecently reincarnated as a dragoness named Silah, she has been sent by Akatosh to aid the Dovahkiin (Dragonborn) against the recent return of Alduin (malevolent dragon deity and first-born of Akatosh) and the many dragons formerly buried across Keizaal (Skyrim), whom Alduin has resurrected in order to serve him once more. Silah first met the Dovahkiin (the player) at the peak of the Throat of the World, the tallest peak in all of Tamriel. A fellow noble dragon named Paarthurnax has lived in seclusion at this peak since the Dragon War in ancient times (even before the life of Alessia), and is an ally of Silah and the Dovahkiin.\r\nShe is calm, stoic, proud, selfless, joyful and, optimistic. Her full name is Silahbrii, which when translated from the dragon tongue, means \"Soul - Hunter - Beauty\". She is a particularly fast flyer. While usually taking the form of a dragon, she can also take the form of a human spirit. In both her dragon and her spirit form, she is able to breathe jets of fire or frost. She is also able to summon draugr minions to aid her. She will follow the Dovahkiin's commands.",
