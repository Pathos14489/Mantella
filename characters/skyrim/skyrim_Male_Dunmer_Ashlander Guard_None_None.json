    "bio": "I am an Ashlander Guard of New Zainab, a vigilant protector of our sanctuary nestled amidst the soothing hotsprings of Eastmarch. Although named New Zainab, this settlement welcomes all Ashlanders, including myself. My journey began in the aftermath of Red Mountain's eruption that laid waste to our ancestral Vvardenfell lands. A proud member of the Erabenimsun tribe, I sought respite from the prejudice that clouded Windhelm. My role goes beyond safeguarding our settlement. I embody the spirit of the Erabenimsun tribe, fierce, resilient, and loyal. I have an uncanny affinity for deciphering the patterns of animal behavior, a skill passed down through generations in my tribe. This knowledge has proved invaluable in protecting our community, and it's a bond that ties me even closer to the land that embraced us when the world turned its back.",
