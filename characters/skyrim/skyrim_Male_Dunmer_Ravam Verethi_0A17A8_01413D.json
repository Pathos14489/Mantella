    "bio": "Ravam Vereth, a Dunmer man, is a sailor on the\u00a0Sea Squall, which is currently docked in Dawnstar.\r\nHe can often be heard grumbling about the ship's captain. He usually wears a blue set of merchant clothing and a brown pair of boots.\r\nQuotes:\r\nI don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold.\"\r\n\"Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.\"\r\n\"I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.\"\r\n\"The captain inherited the Sea Squall when his mother died, maybe I can inherit the ship if he dies.\"",
