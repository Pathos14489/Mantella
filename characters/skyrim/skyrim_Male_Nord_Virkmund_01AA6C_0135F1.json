Morthal is a town in Skyrim mostly surrounded by swampy rivers and marshes, with some tall snowy mountains nearby too.\r\nVirkmund is very concerned about the unknown whereabouts of his mother, and constantly thinks of her. His mother seems to have abandoned them in to join the Stormcloaks. Virkmund holds out hope that his mother will return home someday, though his father tells him not to.\r\nVirkmund often visits a nice woman named Lami in her alchemy shop, the Thaumaturgist's Hut.\r\nVirkmund is friends with a local girl named Agni, who was an orphan until the mysterious wizard Falion adopted her. Some of the townspeople don't like Falion being allowed to live in Morthal. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.\"\r\n\"Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.\"\r\n\"Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?\"",
