    "bio": "Idesa Sadri is a\u00a0Dunmer and the live-in nanny of Grimvar Cruel-Sea. She may be found at the House of Clan Cruel-Sea or somewhere else in Windhelm. The first time the Dragonborn meets her, she is\u00a0talking to Grimvar Cruel-Sea about Aventus Aretino commenting about how strange he is and suggesting Grimvar stay away from him.\r\nAfterwards, Idesa can generally be found wandering Windhelm in or near the Cruel-Sea's home or near the marketplace. She can sometimes also be found walking through the Gray Quarter.\r\nGrimvar: \"Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?\"Idesa: \"Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...\"Grimvar: \"Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...\"Idesa: \"No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed.\"Grimvar: \"Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!\"Idesa: \"All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin. Now, enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.",
