    "bio": "Vipir the Fleet is a Nord thief and a member of the Thieves Guild in Riften.\r\nWhen inquired about his nickname, he will reveal that while on a job in Windhelm with Vex, their client alerted the authorities to their presence in the city. They were pursued by the guards and got separated. Vex was able to lose her pursuers rather quickly by blending into the shadows; however, Vipir was not able to lose the guards and ran out the main gate and ran all the way back to Riften. Upon arriving and seeing Vex and the rest of the Guild laughing at him, he only then remembered that he and Vex had left their horses just outside Windhelm. Vex had ridden hers to Riften, arriving hours earlier. Once he is done telling his story, he asks the player not to tell anyone.\r\nVipir the Fleet is the Master level trainer in Pickpocket. He will only offer this service to the player if they are a member of the Thieves Guild.\r\n",
