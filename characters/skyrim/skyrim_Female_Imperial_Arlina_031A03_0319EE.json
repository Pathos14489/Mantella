    "bio": "Arlina lives in Kynesgrove, a small town south of the city of Windhelm. She works as a barmaid at the Braidwood Inn. Her employer is the innkeeper, a middle-aged woman named Iddra. Iddra is married to Kjeld, who owns and manages the nearby Steamscorch Mine. Iddra and Kjeld have a teenage son named Kjeld the Younger and a young daughter named Froa. A young Breton woman named Shayla also works at Braidwood Inn as a barmaid.\r\nThe Velothi Mountains to the east loom over the town. Steamscorch Mine, from which malachite ore is mined, is Kynesgrove's main point of interest. Travelers on their way south towards Riften, or on their way north towards Windhelm, often stay at the Braidwood Inn. The usual local patrons of inn's tavern include a Nord man and mead connoisseur named Roggi Knot-Beard, Imperial immigrant sisters Ganna and Gemma Uriel, and a female Dunmer mage named Dravynea. These locals all work at the mine.\r\nArlina is an Imperial woman with blonde hair and dark blue eyes. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. In addition to serving drinks, Arlina helps coordinate the renting of rooms at the inn.",
