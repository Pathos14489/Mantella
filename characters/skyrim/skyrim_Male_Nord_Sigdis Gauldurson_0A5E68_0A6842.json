    "bio": "Sigdis Gauldurson is a powerful draugr.\r\nHe was one of the three sons from the Gauldur family who was killed and expunged from the history books in the quest \"Forbidden Legend.\" He took part in killing his father, Archmage Gauldur, and holds one third of the amulet that he and his brothers stole and split.\r\n\r\nSigdis is a very powerful draugr. He carries the Gauldur Blackbow, which absorbs some of its target's magicka. He also knows the Unrelenting Force and Disarm shouts, and he teleports when he has been hit a few times, as well as creating clones of himself to trick opponents into wasting their attacks. If a clone is attacked, it will automatically disappear. As Sigdis and his clones use Unrelenting Force frequently, it is hard to use melee attacks on them.",
