    "bio": "Balbus is a Nord man who roams Skyrim. He is a fan of the Gourmet and is collecting ingredients for him.\r\nIf the player claims to be the Gourmet, Balbus will believe them, as long as they show him the document named \u201cThe Gourmet's writ of passage\u201d.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I'm collecting ingredients to bring to the Gourmet. He'll think my tastes so refined when I offer them to him. You have heard of the Gourmet?\"\r\n\u201cThe Gourmet keeps his identity a secret. I'm hoping to discover who he is, so I can tell him how he changed my life. For all I know, the Gourmet is a woman!\"\r\n\u201cThe Gourmet is the author of 'Uncommon Taste'. He's a wizard with a spatula. Well, not an actual wizard, but his recipes are legendary.\"\r\n\"You know, I've heard that the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now...\"\r\nIf the player shows him the document named \u201cThe Gourmet's writ of passage\u201d: \"Oh my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold. I've cooked every dish in your book, and I must say your brilliance is inspiring. My technique doesn't even approach yours...but whose would? Allow me to give you this, the fork I used the first time I tasted one of your dishes. Oh, and these ingredients I've been collecting for you. I've risked life and limb so that you may create another masterpiece. Make sure to think of me when you use them!\"",
