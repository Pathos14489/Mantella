    "bio": "Gunjar, a Nord man, is a carriage driver. He can be hired by Lakeview Manor's steward.\r\nThe advantage to hiring Gunjar, as well as the other personal carriage drivers, is the numerous places he can take the player that the main carriage drivers will not. Since Gunjar has already been hired by the player's steward, he does not charge for the journey.",
