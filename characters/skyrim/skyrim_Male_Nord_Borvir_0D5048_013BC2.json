    "bio": "Borvir was an apprentice mage at the College of Winterhold. His corpse can be found at Journeyman's Nook, adjacent a bandit and a named dagger.\r\nAlthough able to be found at any point, Phinis Gestor will mention Borvir and his brother among four students who went missing from College of Winterhold, recalling they were working on a way to magically chill mead. Due to the unfinished nature of the quest, there is no further mentioning of him, quest stages, or objectives that point to his location. The location where he can be found suggests the bandit also found there most likely murdered him.",
