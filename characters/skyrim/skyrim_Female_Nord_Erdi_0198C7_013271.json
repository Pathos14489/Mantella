    "bio": "Erdi is a young Nord woman who works as a maid at the Blue Palace in Solitude. She works alongside Una.\r\nShe has the key to the Pelagius Wing of the palace. If asked for the key, she initially refuses, stating that she will get in trouble and that the Pelagius Wing is scary, but will eventually relinquish the key if the player mentions\u00a0Falk Firebeard's name.\r\nIf the player is a man, Erdi will ask him if he is her knight who will take her to his castle and go adventuring together. If the player is a woman, Erdi will talk about traveling Skyrim together and mentions her dream of a dashing knight rescuing her from her boring life.",
