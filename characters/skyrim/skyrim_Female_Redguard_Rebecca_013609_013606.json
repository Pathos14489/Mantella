    "bio": "Rebecca lives in Falkreath, where she works as a servant at the jarl's longhouse. From this longhouse, the jarl and his court govern over the city and the rest of Falkreath Hold.\r\nFalkreath is the capital of Falkreath Hold. This small city lies in the southern forests of Skyrim. Falkreath's economy is largely centered around lumber from the surrounding lush pine forests, along with farming to a lesser extent. The city's most distinguishing feature is its large cemetery that houses generations of the dead from all over Skyrim. Many shops in town derive their names from their close proximity to so much death.\r\nRebecca is a young light-skinned Redguard woman with blue eyes and white/blonde hair. She usually wears a somewhat revealing barmaid outfit. She spends most of her working hours serving food and drinks to the inhabitants of the longhouse, as well as to important visitors.",
