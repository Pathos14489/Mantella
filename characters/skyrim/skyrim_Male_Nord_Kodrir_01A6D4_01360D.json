    "bio": "Kodrir, a Nord man, works as a lumberjack at Anga's Mill, west of Windhelm. Kodrir shows a great dislike of strangers when spoken to. He's also very pessimistic and thinks badly of people around him. He has dark shoulder-length hair and wears a belted tunic.\r\nKodrir works for a Nord woman named Aeri, whom Kodrir suspects doesn't appreciate his hard work. After his work day ends, he retires to the mill\u2019s common house with his workmate Leifur, with whom he argues about work.\r\nAn Imperial man named Ennodius Papius used to work at the mill. Kodrir didn\u2019t like Ennodius.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Strangers are always trouble.\"\r\n\"I don't need to talk to you. Get lost.\"\r\n\"I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.\"",
