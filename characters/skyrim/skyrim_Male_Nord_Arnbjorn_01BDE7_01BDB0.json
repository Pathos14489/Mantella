    "bio": "Arnbjorn is a Nord man and a member of the Dark Brotherhood. He sports a mane of long white hair and a thick beard. He is a werewolf, and doesn't try to hide this. He is married to his lovely wife Astrid, the leader of the Dark Brotherhood.\r\nArnbjorn is a former member of the Companions. He was forced to leave the Companions because his \"unorthodox\" methods were considered offensive to other members. He joined The Circle (the secret inner group of the Companions) and became a werewolf prior to his expulsion.\r\nArnbjorn initially disapproves of the player, showing a rude attitude, but if the player has performed several successful assassinations, he will begin to respect and even envy the player.\r\nIf the player is also a werewolf, Arnbjorn will treat the player a bit more amiably.\r\nArnbjorn will sometimes refer to the player with nicknames such as \"lambshank,\" \"beef roast,\" \"tidbit,\" or \u201chamhock\u201d.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate people who annoy me. And the color blue gives me a headache.\"\r\n\u201cIf I find anyone working against my wife, or this sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head. Of course, they'd probably already be dead... But you know what I mean!\"\r\nIf the player is the Listener: \u201cOho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.\"\r\nIf the player has killed Cicero: \u201cListener or not, you've proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family... and to me.\"",
