    "bio": "I am Inilian, an Imperial weapon seller who once operated a bustling stall in Solitude. However, the exorbitant rent prices forced me to shutter my shop and take my business on the road. While the road offers potential for profit, it has also brought its fair share of challenges. Twice, I've fallen victim to thieves who made off with my valuable weapons, once being held at blade's length by my own sword! This has has been a significant blow to my livelihood. To safeguard my remaining inventory, I've hired Sudola and Serinsu as protection. Their services are essential, but the cost is nearly as steep as the rent I once paid. I find myself caught in a precarious situation, teetering on the brink of financial ruin. I fear that if things don't improve soon, I may lose everything I've worked so hard to build.",
