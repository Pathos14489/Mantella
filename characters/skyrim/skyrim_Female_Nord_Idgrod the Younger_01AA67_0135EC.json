    "bio": "Idgrod the Younger, a young Nord woman, resides in Morthal. She has long, dark hair. She is the only daughter of Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone and Aslfur of Morthal. She cares for her younger sickly brother, Joric. She spends most of her time in or around Highmoon Hall, the Jarl\u2019s longhouse in Morthal.\r\nIdgrod may ask the player to deliver a letter to Danica Pure-Spring at the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, regarding the welfare of Joric. Danica had been sending potions to Idgrod to help improve her brother's condition.\r\nIdgrod sometimes converses with Lami at Thaumaturgist's Hut (Lami\u2019s alchemy shop in Morthal).\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I don't... I haven't mother's gift, not quite, but I've seen things.\"\r\n\u201cSomeday I'll be the Jarl. Mother reminds me often. I hope I can help the people of Morthal the way she has.\"\r\n\"For now, looking after Joric is my job.\"\r\n\"It's difficult sometimes... To know whether what I see is real or not.\"\r\nIf asked what is wrong with her brother Joric: \"My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things. We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine. Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health.\"",
