    "bio": "Sild the Warlock, a Nord man, is a necromancer residing in the ancient Nord crypt called Rannveig's Fast.\r\nEnslaving the ghosts\u00a0of those who died via the traps he has set up in the crypt, Sild forces them to fight intruders. He conducts sadistic experiments with those his trap ensnares, enjoying the slow taking of other mortals' lives as much as that of their souls.\r\nOne of his traps is a covered pit that adventurers frequently fall into when running for a conveniently placed chest. Those who fall land in a cage that contains water and the corpses of Sild's past victims. The cage is locked with an expert lock. Sild carries a Key on his person, which opens his treasure chest and the cage; there is also a satchel next to the cage with another copy of the same key in it (near his assistant's body).",
