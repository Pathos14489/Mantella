    "bio": "Orla, a young Nord woman, is a priestess of Dibella at the Temple of Dibella in Markarth. She wears hooded monk robes.\r\nOrla serves under Hamal, the head priestess of Dibella in Markarth. Hamal is an older Nord woman, and is often referred to as \u201cThe Mother\u201d by the other priestesses. Other priestesses at the temple include Senna (a Breton woman) and Anwen (a Redguard woman).\r\nIf the player has successfully rescued the new Sybil of Dibella (a Nord girl named Fjotra) from her captivity by the Forsworn, and the player is wearing an Amulet of Mara (signaling one\u2019s intention of finding a spouse), Orla will accept a marriage proposal from the player.\r\nOrla is so devoted to her duties as a priestess of Dibella that she rarely leaves the temple. However, if Orla marries the player, she will be willing to live at the player\u2019s house instead.\r\nIf the player and Orla get married, Orla will open a general goods shop to provide some extra income for herself and her new spouse. She will give her spouse 100 gold daily from the store\u2019s profits.\r\nOrla is somewhat skilled with magic, and she knows the following spells: Conjure Familiar, Frostbite, and Fast Healing.",
