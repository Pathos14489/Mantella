    "bio": "Ralof, a Nord man, is a member of the Stormcloak Rebellion. He hails from the town of Riverwood. He has blond hair and blue eyes. He usually wears a set of blue Stormcloak armor. He wields a two-handed warhammer in battle.\r\nRalof, along with Ulfric Stormcloak and a group of Stormcloak soldiers, was recently captured by an Imperial ambush at Darkwater Crossing. Afterwards, Ralof and the Stormcloaks were escorted to the town of Helgen to be executed. However, a great and terrible black dragon interrupted the execution process, breathing fire and raining down meteors from the sky which devastated and eventually destroyed Helgen. This dragon attack incidentally saved Ralof and many of the Stormcloaks (including Ulfric) by allowing them to escape from the Imperials during the chaos created by the dragon attack.\r\nRalof has known Hadvar (the nephew of Alvor, Riverwood\u2019s blacksmith) since they were children. Hadvar unfortunately chose the opposing side in the Skyrim civil war conflict, becoming an Imperial legionnaire. Hadvar presided over the execution of Stormcloak prisoners at Helgen until the dragon attacked.\r\nIf the player chooses to follow Ralof instead of Hadvar during the chaos of the dragon attack at Helgen, Ralof will accompany the player through the caves under Helgen\u2019s keep. If Ralof and the player survive and escape Helgen, Ralof will then travel with the player to Riverwood, a relatively short distance north of Helgen. Once arriving in Riverwood, Ralof will then meet up with his sister Gerdur and her husband Hod at their lumber mill and introduce the player to Gerdur and Hod as the person who saved his life at Helgen. Ralof will then take up temporary residence at Gerdur and Hod\u2019s house while hiding from Imperial Legion patrols, and Gerdur will invite the player to temporarily stay at their house as well. During this time, Ralof will try to convince the player of the righteousness of the Stormcloak cause and will invite them to travel to Windhelm in order to join the Stormcloak army.\r\nGerdur and Hod own and operate Riverwood\u2019s lumber mill. Because this lumber mill is focal to Riverwood's prosperity, Gerdur and Hod are considered the town's leaders. Gerdur and Hod have a young son named Frodnar, who is fond of Ralof and wants to be a Stormcloak soldier like him.\r\nRalof will eventually be promoted to the rank of Captain, and if the player joins the Stormcloak forces, Ralof will assist the player in various missions for the Stormcloaks. One of these missions will involve retrieving the legendary Jagged Crown from the ancient Nordic crypt of Korvanjund. Another mission will involve rescuing Stormcloak prisoners of war from the Imperials at Fort Neugrad. \r\nQuotes:\r\nIf inside the Helgen Keep during the dragon attack: \"Looks like we're the only ones who made it. That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children\u2019s stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times. We should keep moving.\u201d\r\nAfter escaping the caves under Helgen: \"Wait! There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time. No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We better clear out of here. My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.\"\r\n\"You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today. If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric.\"\r\nIf asked about the Stormcloaks: \u201cThe Nords are tired of spending our blood fighting the Empire's wars, and paying for the Empire's decadence with our taxes. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He's leading the fight to drive the Empire out of Skyrim, once and for all.\u201d\r\nIf at Korvanjund: \"Ha! I knew you'd join up. Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh? I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it. These old ruins... my father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say. Never mind all that; we've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way!\"\r\nIf at Fort Neugrad: \u201cWell, well. Look who it is! How have you been? This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun. You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there... Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...\"\r\n\"Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Imperials and join forces for just a little while take care of some of these dragons?\"\r\n\"I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like.\"\r\n\"I've heard some things about Ulfric I don't like, but he's right about this war and about Skyrim's future.\"",
