    "bio": "Ataf is a Redguard bard who can be found in the Bards College, in Solitude. He has brown hair and is cleanly shaven.\r\nHe is the youngest bard admitted to the Bards College, and claims that he is the best bard that one can find. \r\nPantea Ateia will offer constructive criticism to his performance of Ragnar the Red. \r\nIlldi and Aia Arria will talk about Ataf\u2019s possible infatuation with Illdi, a young Nord woman who is also a student at the college. Illdi will say that Ataf has been looking at her frequently. \r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service.\"\r\n\"I went out ice fishing a few days ago.\"\r\n\u201cViarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.\"\r\n\"I think Illdi's better than Dean Pantea actually knows. She just gets intimidated when she's in class and can't sing.\"",
