When activated, he appears and offers to trade much like a regular merchant\u00a0would. He will buy any type of item, except stolen items, and he sells armor and weapons based on the Dragonborn's level at that moment. At higher levels, he is the only merchant in the game who will sell Daedric weapons.",
