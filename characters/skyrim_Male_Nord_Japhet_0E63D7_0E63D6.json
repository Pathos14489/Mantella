    "bio": "Japhet was a warrior whose corpse can be found in the cellar of Japhet's Folly. The cellar can be found behind an expert locked door at the bottom of the main tower. The room is full of spider webs. The Dragonborn can find Japhet's Journal, a leveled sword and a master-locked chest next to his corpse.\r\nHe was the son of a farmer, and set out with a small company of men from Dawnstar to create a fortress which is now Japhet's Folly. The locals believed the island was haunted. Eventually, his followers left him one by one, but he refused to give up. He eventually died in the cellar, convinced that the rumors about Japhet's Folly being haunted were true.",
