    "bio": "Aquillius Aeresius is an Imperial man living in Solitude. He wears a set of fine clothes and fine boots.\r\nHe lives at Vittoria Vici's house, but his relationship to Vittoria is purely platonic. Vittoria Vici is the cousin of the Emperor of Tamriel, Titus Mede the Second. Vittoria is engaged to be married to Asgeir Snow-Shod, a Nord man from Riften. They plan to have a large wedding ceremony and reception in the Castle Dour courtyard.\r\nAquillius sometimes attends Thalmor parties at the Thalmor Embassy north of Solitude.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.\"\r\n\"I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.\"",
