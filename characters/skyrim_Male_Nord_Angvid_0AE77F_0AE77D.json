    "bio": "Angvid is a Nord man who works as a miner at Whistling Mine. His hair is white. Whistling Mine is a small iron mine southeast of Winterhold. The mine is situated along the southern path that leads out of Winterhold towards Windhelm, at the base of the mountains.\r\nAngvid wears a standard miner's outfit and carries an iron mace. He can usually be found swinging a pickaxe at various ore veins around the mine. When not working, Angvid can usually be found sleeping in one of the bedrolls just inside the mine. Angvid is not sure if continuing to work at the mine is worth it because of the lack of ore, and he is losing faith in both Thorgar and the mine. \r\nThorgar is the Nord man who owns the rights to the mine, also helping in the mining efforts. Unlike Angvid, Thorgar optimistically still believes that they will strike something better than iron and become rich, even though the mine barely even has any iron. Badnir and Gunding are two of the other miners at the mine, both of them strong Nord men. Angvid, Thorgar, Bandir, and Gunding all sleep in bedrolls just inside the mine.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold.\"\r\n\"I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.\"\r\n\"Is it still worth it? When do you decide enough is enough, and just walk away?\"",
