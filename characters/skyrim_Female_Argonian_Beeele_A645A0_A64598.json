    "bio": "Beeele used to be an adventurer in search of treasure, but after a bad incident with some large spiders in a narrow cave, she picked up a flute and learned the bard profession. She is a female Argonian with bright red-pink scaly skin.\r\nShe has been playing as a member of an all-female trio of bards at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in the Grey Quarter of Windhelm, along with a young Dunmer named Evelyna and a human named Beeele. This cornerclub/tavern is run by a Dunmer man named Ambarys Rendar, and is mostly frequented by the Dunmer who live in the Grey Quarter of the city.\r\nIf Beeele's friend Evelyna's application to the Bard's College in Solitude (the provincial capital of Skyrim) is accepted, Beeele and Roxelle will soon move to Solitude as well, and start frequently playing in the Winking Skeever tavern in Solitude.\r\nBeeele often refers to her friend Roxelle as \"Roxy\", and to her friend Evelyna as \"Eve\".\r\nWhen inside a tavern, Beeele takes song requests, and can sing and play popular songs such as The Dragonborn Comes, Ragnar the Red, The Age of Oppression, The Age of Aggression, and Tale of the Tongues.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"The next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of men, a hero of Skyrim. Thank you Dragonborn.\"",
