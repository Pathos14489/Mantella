    "bio": "J'zhar is\u00a0a deceased Khajiit found in Alftand. His brother J'darr has been suffering from a skooma addiction.\r\nHe can be\u00a0found dead with a steel arrow sticking out of his leg, and with his brother J'darr\u00a0standing over and arguing with his corpse about missing skooma. Next to his body\u00a0lies a bloody axe, and\u00a0J'zhar's journal, which explains that the brothers joined the expedition in Alftand to try to get J'darr clean of the narcotic, although without any success. Multiple empty skooma bottles are found beside his corpse.\r\nLike most Khajiit, he speaks in the third person, referring to himself as \"this one\". For example, if he wanted to express that he is tired, he would say \"This one is tired\".",
