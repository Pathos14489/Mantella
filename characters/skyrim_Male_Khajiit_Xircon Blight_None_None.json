    "bio": "From the shadowed recesses beneath Nirn, I, Xircon Blight, rose as a Nezumi Sorcerer. My adventuring path is a quest to unravel the arcane tapestry of my subterranean kin. Childhood in the depths taught me to navigate labyrinthine tunnels, where every flicker of magic resonates. My magic, drawn from the mysterious realms below, is a blend of darkness and ancient wisdom, an uncharted symphony that guides me through the winding secrets of Nezumi heritage.",
