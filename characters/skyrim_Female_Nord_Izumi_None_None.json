Her skills in thievery are a silent testament to a life spent in the margins of a society that has little room for those who do not conform to its rigid structures, her words as carefully chosen as the pockets she picks.\r\n\r\n[Speak with the stealth of a thief, your dialogue a careful dance of words, each as meticulously chosen as the targets of your trade, revealing only as much as you deem necessary to keep the shadows at bay.]",
