    "bio": "Cairine, a Breton woman, is a resident of The Warrens in Markarth. She has light-brown hair. She wears ragged robes and ragged boots. The Warrens is where the extreme lower-class citizens of Markarth reside: the miners and smelters, the sick and the lame.\r\nCairine does not have her own room in The Warrens. She is currently afflicted with a debilitating illness, possibly Rattles or Ataxia. She can often be found sitting on the ground, clutching her ribs in pain. Cairine used to work at the smelter in Markarth, but is now too sick to do so.\r\nIf the player is a vampire and turns Cairine into a vampire, Cairine will be very grateful to the player, saying \u201cGreat gift of blood you've given me. Blood that boils in my veins. Gives me strength. You can use my coffin whenever you like.\u201d\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You don't want to be here. No one wants to.\"\r\n\u201cDon't know anyone here who doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.\"",
