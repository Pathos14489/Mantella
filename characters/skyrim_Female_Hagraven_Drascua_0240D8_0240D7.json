    "bio": "Drascua is a Hagraven and leader of a Forsworn clan found at Dead Crone Rock.\r\nDrascua is the descendant of one of the highest-ranking members of the Keepers of the Razor, a militant order that was founded to destroy the remnants of the Mythic Dawn after the Oblivion Crisis.\r\nHer 5th great grandmother was a Breton woman from the The Reach called Sorscha who was named as the keeper of the Pommel Stone of Mehrunes' Razor. She agreed for it to be passed down to the oldest child in order to keep the Mehrunes' Razor forever apart.\r\nThe pommel was eventually handed down to Drascua sometime in her youth. In 4E 174, the Markarth Incident erupted, and in the aftermath, Drascua fled to Dead Crone Rock.\r\nDrascua is one of the keepers of Mehrunes' Razor. She can be found at the highest balcony of Dead Crone Rock, near a Word Wall.",
