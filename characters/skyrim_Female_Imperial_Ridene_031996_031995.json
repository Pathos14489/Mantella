The bar is strongly associated with the Thieves Guild, whose members often patronize the bar. The Thieves Guild's main hideout is nearby in the Ratway.\r\nThe Flagon is run by Vekel, who some call \"Vekel the Man\". Vekel's girlfriend is a Redguard woman named Tonilia, who serves as a fence for stolen goods and usually hangs around the Flagon. A man named Dirge works at the Flagon as the bouncer. A woman named Vex and a Breton man named Delvin are two of the Thieves Guild's most important members, and they can usually be found in the Flagon. A mysterious female Bosmer in hooded robes usually sits in the back of the bar.\r\nTatriana is an Imperial woman with long brown hair and turquoise eyes. She wears clothing typical of a female barkeeper. She has a coworker barmaid named Tatriana. When working, Ridene walks around the bar serving drinks and food.",
