He can be found in Solitude, near Angeline's Aromatics.\r\nHe will approach the player, claiming that he has a plan to rob an Imperial ship which will soon dock in Solitude. He will ask them to go to the Solitude Lighthouse and put out the fire there so that the ship will wreck on the nearby coast.\r\nAfter extinguishing the fire at Solitude Lighthouse, Jaree-Ra will instruct the player to go to the Wreck of the Icerunner to claim their reward. Once there, his sister Deeja will attempt to kill them, on Jaree-Ra's secret orders. Jaree-Ra will then hide at Broken Oar Grotto with the remaining members of the Blackblood Marauders.",
