    "bio": "Tormir is a Nord resident of Darkwater Crossing in Skyrim who works at Goldenrock Mine.\r\nTormir is the mother of Hrefna and sometimes references Hrefna's father negatively, saying she is not happy with him and if Hrefna knew him, she would not be either.\r\nShe also mentions a man named Dasturn, implying he cannot be trusted. She also has qualms about an elf named Meieran, who does not appear in the game, teaching her daughter and being friendly with her. Due to the pressures of both mining and caring for her daughter, Sondas Drenim helps to take care of Hrefna.\r\nIf Kjeld is killed, Tormir may send a letter to the Dragonborn saying that they aided her, and that she will provide a reward.",
