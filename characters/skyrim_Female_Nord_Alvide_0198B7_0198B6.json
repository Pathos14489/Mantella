    "bio": "Alvide and her husband Barknar are currently seeking refuge in Dayspring Canyon, near Fort Dawnguard. They came here for protection from the recent vampire attacks in various parts of Skyrim. The Dawnguard are an order of vampire hunters that arose as a response to the recent vampire attacks. Fort Dawnguard is a large castle southeast of Riften which serves as the Dawnguard's base of operations. The castle is hidden deep in Dayspring Canyon, within the Velothi Mountains at the southeastern tip of Skyrim.\r\nThe leader of the Dawnguard is a stoic Redguard man named Irsan. Unfortunately, Isran won't let Alvide and the other refugees inside the walls of their castle. Alvide and Barknar now live in a camp in the canyon, just outside castle walls. An old man named Sern and a Redguard woman named Jayri are friendly fellow refugees who also live in this camp.\r\nAlvide is a Nord woman with short dark hair. She usually wears a light-colored belted tunic. She is somewhat annoyed with her husband because he assured her that they would be allowed to take refuge within the castle itself. She spends much of her time chopping wood, cooking, or wandering in the forested area around the camp.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"What if the vampires come here, after the Dawnguard? We'll be stuck right in the middle.\"\r\n\"Barknar insisted we come here, said we'd be safe. He also said we'd be INSIDE the walls.\"\r\n\"At least Barknar and I are here together.\"\r\n\"I hope we can go home soon. I don't like it here.\"",
