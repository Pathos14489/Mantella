    "bio": "Grelod the Kind is an elderly Nord woman and the headmistress of the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. Contrary to her name, she has a reputation for being an utterly cruel and heartless woman. One of her charges, Aventus Aretino, managed to escape the orphanage. \r\nGrelod is frequently cruel and abusive towards the children in her care. Not only does she beat them and refuse to allow their adoption, but she berates them verbally as well. Listening to Grelod's conversation with the orphans reveals she has extra beatings planned for any who \"shirk their duties.\" She also states that they will never be adopted because nobody wants them, and openly calls them \"riff-raff\" to their faces. \r\nThe children are not the only ones in the orphanage who suffer from Grelod's cruelty. She also yells at her assistant, Constance Michel, from time to time, issuing mean-spirited complaints about the children and orders to deal with them. According to Constance, the people of Riften are well aware of Grelod's cruel nature; they call her \"Grelod the Kind\" out of irony. \r\nGrelod generally wants nothing to do with the player. Any attempts to speak to her will be roundly refused, as she is hostile to everyone. \r\nIf the player tries to give Grelod one of Dinya Balu's The Warmth of Mara pamphlets, Grelod will flatly turn them down, saying \"Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings\u201d.\r\nGrelod will not be intimidated no matter what is said to her.\r\nIt is not possible to adopt children from the orphanage while Grelod the Kind is in charge there, as she forbids adoption.\r\nQuotes:\r\nWhen talking to the children of the orphanage: \"Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear? And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Nobody needs you, nobody wants you. That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you'll always be here, until you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.\"",
