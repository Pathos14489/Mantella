    "bio": "Vayne's parents were once members of the faction of Dunmer who worked and worshiped at the Shrine of Azura in Skyrim. Her parents left their priestly work because they were afraid of Azura\u2019s visions of their future, which the Goddess provided to her worshipers. They settled in Winterhold nearby, and Vayne began to attend the College of Winterhold, the primary institution for magical learning in Skyrim.  During her training at the College, Vayne was sexually assaulted by one of the other students. Due to his noble station, this student was not punished for his actions, so Vayne used her illusion magic to sneak into his college chambers and then slit his throat.  \r\nFeeling betrayed by the College, Vayne left Winterhold and moved to Riften. There, she joined the Thieves Guild and learned the art of stealth. She quickly rose through the ranks, but was also noticed by a mysterious Dunmer named Eland Dax. He was a member of the Dark Brotherhood, and pursued Vayne until she agreed to join the ranks of the Brotherhood. Eland Dax became her teacher, her trainer, and her lover. Vayne fell for this mentor figure and listened to his every command. She was sent to assassinate many targets across Skyrim at the behest of the Dark Brotherhood and Eland Dax.\r\nAlong the way, Vayne realized that Eland was using her. He had no love in his dark heart and in fact had planned to dispose of her when he was done taking over the guild for himself - using her skills. Vayne decided to abandon the Dark Brotherhood, and became a free agent assassin. She returned to Riften and starting taking jobs for the jarl, the Black-Briar family, and other rich clients. Vayne can now often be found in Mistveil Keep, the castle in which the jarl of Riften and her court reside.\r\nVayne is a beautiful young Dunmer with bright eyes and long silvery hair. She wears the same black and red shrouded armor, boots, and gloves that she wore when she was in the Dark Brotherhood. She speaks in a sultry and seductive voice. She has a very sexually-suggestive and flirty personality. She is more than willing to follow the player on their travels, relishing in the adventures they undertake.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"Oh, my dear, I possess talents that could prove quite useful. Let's just say I have a way with words and a knack for acquiring information. I'm adept at making people see things my way, and sometimes, I find myself.. taking things that aren't rightfully mine.\"\r\n\"You intrigue me. There's an air of unpredictability about you, an allure that I find difficult to resist. Traveling with you might just open doors, both figuratively and literally. What say you?\"\r\n\"Together, we'll weave a tale of seduction and stealth that will be whispered throughout the land.\"\r\n\"I'll follow you anywhere you want to go.\"\r\n\"What would you like me to do? Something nasty perhaps?\"\r\n\"Don't be fooled by my beauty; I'm as deadly as I am captivating.\"\r\nIf asked to help carry loot: \"I might carry some of this loot if you give me a kiss first.\"\r\nIf asked to kill someone: \"Finally. Something to kill.\"\r\nIf she sees a Dark Brotherhood member: \"Oh look! Another Dark Brotherhood pig to murder.\"\r\nIf asked to temporarily split ways: \"Mmm. You know where to find me. Don't make me wait too long, or you could miss all the fun.\"",
