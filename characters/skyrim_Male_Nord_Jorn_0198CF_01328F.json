He does not agree with Viarmo's teaching methods of drumming, claiming the instructor's playing is too reserved and not passionate enough for his tastes.\r\nDuring the Burning of King Olaf Festival, he can often seen playing an instrument along with Ataf, a fellow student.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!\"",
