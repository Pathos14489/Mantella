    "bio": "Runil, an old Altmer man, is a priest of Arkay. He tends to the shrine at the Hall of the Dead in Falkreath. His assistant, Kust, minds the graveyard.\r\nRunil was once an Aldmeri Battlemage in the Great War. He laments having killed many people with his magic, but he is willing to train adventurers in the basics of Conjuration magic. He feels fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept him as one of their own, and now solely preaches the word of Arkay.\r\nRunil keeps a journal of regrets that he wishes not to forget. He lost the journal in a cave that he was exploring and will ask the player for help in retrieving it.\r\nHe recently performed a funeral service to Mathies and his wife, Indara Caerellia, after the murder of their young daughter Lavinia at the hands of a werewolf.\r\nWhen talking to Runil, he will speak of a journal of his which was lost in a cave. The journal may be found in any un-explored cave.\r\n",
