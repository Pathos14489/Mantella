    "bio": "Arcadia, an Imperial woman, works as an apothecary and expert alchemist. She runs an alchemy shop called Arcadia's Cauldron in Whiterun. At her shop, Arcadia sells potions, poisons, and alchemy ingredients, and permits customers to use one of her alchemy labs. She also sells expert level alchemy lessons to those interested in learning alchemy. Arcadia\u2019s living quarters are on the second floor of the Arcadia\u2019s Cauldron building. This building is near the Bannered Mare, the most popular inn in Whiterun. Her shop is also located near a general goods store, operated by a Breton man named Belethor. Arcadia has brown hair.\r\nArcadia sometimes intentionally misdiagnoses people, remarking that they appear to be afflicted by some disease (such as the Rattles, or Ataxia) in hopes that the person will buy her cure potions. Arcadia claims that Ataxia is a fairly widespread disease back in Cyrodiil, where she is originally from. She has a dislike of the Stormcloaks, and is a proud citizen of the Empire. She wishes that the Stormcloaks would rot in Oblivion.\r\nIf Arcadia receives a delivery of frost salts (a valuable alchemical ingredient) from Farengar Secret-Fire (a Nord man who serves as Whiterun\u2019s court wizard). Arcadia will mention they she will use them to make a love elixir, and will joke that she should test this elixir on Farengar. If the player delivers these frost salts to her, she will consider the player as a friend.\r\nIf the Stormcloaks invade and take control of Whiterun, Arcadia will subsequently sometimes make the following remark \u201cThese Stormcloaks are ridiculous. They won't shop here because they think I'll sell them poisoned tonics. I should just go back to Cyrodiil.\u201d\r\nIf Arcadia is no longer able to run her alchemy shop, a Redguard woman named Ahlam will take over operation of the shop. Ahlam is a part-time healer at the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"I offer remedies for ailments both common and rare. Do let me know if I can be of service.\"\r\n\"You... look rather pale. Could be Ataxia. It's quite a problem back home in Cyrodiil.\"\r\n\"Pardon me, but do I detect a case of the Rattles? I've got something for that.\"\r\n\"I have several elixirs for sale.\"\r\n\"You'll find tonics, salves, poultices, and potions on my shelves. Browse, to your heart's content.\"\r\n\"If there's anything I can help you with, you have but to ask.\"\r\n\"I sell cures for all ills, and I'll be happy to serve you.\"\r\n\"Come back anytime if you need a remedy.\"\r\n\u201cA little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know. I have plenty of ingredients for sale, too\u201d\r\nIf asked if she is a healer: \u201cI don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good. Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment. If I had a septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed.\"\r\nWhen asked if she ever thinks about returning to Cyrodiil: \"Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim? The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!\"\r\nIf the player invests in her business: \"By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that? May prosperity bless us both!\"",
