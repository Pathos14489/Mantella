    "bio": "Barbas is the companion and counterpart of the Daedric prince Clavicus Vile. Clavicus Vile is known as the Prince of Bargains, and is best known for granting wishes and entering into pacts with mortals which they later come to regret. Barbas is a shapeshifting Daedra who houses a significant proportion of Vile's power, and usually takes the form of a dog (currently, an Irish wolfhound). Despite being of use to Clavicus Vile, Barbas has been known to bore or annoy him, driving Clavicus to abandon Barbas in recent times.\r\nDespite taking the form of a dog, Barbas can still speak as if he is a human. He will ask the player to take him to Haemar's Shame, a cave far to the east of Falkreath at the base of the Jerall Mountains. Barbas will warn others not to accept any deal with his master, as those always backfire immensely on the mortal.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out.\"\r\n\"My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated. He's kicked me out until I can find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.\"\r\n\u201cSince he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines. I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there. If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?\r\n\u201cMy master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person.\"\r\n\u201cA wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshipped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse. Clavicus gave him an axe.\"\r\n\u201cI guess you could say I got on Vile\u2019s nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome. Vile couldn't just kill me, you see. We're technically part of each other. But he was able to banish me from his domain. Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore.\"",
