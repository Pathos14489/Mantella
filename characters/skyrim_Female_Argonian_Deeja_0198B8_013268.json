    "bio": "Deeja is an Argonian woman living in Solitude. She wears a set of hide armor, and carries a high quality dagger. She can often be found at the Solitude docks, near the East Empire Company Warehouse. Deeja and her brother Jaree-Ra are employed by Vittoria Vici at the East Empire Company.\r\nDeeja is very antisocial, and if the player attempts to converse with her, she will tell the player to back off and stop talking to her. She is extremely rude to the player, and will not answer questions.\r\nAt night, Deeja sometimes spends time aboard the Red Wave, a ship docked at the Solitude Docks. The Red Wave is secretly a pirate ship.\r\nDeeja is secretly a member of the Blackblood Marauders, a clan of bandits who are active in the area around Solitude. Her brother Jaree-Ra is secretly the leader of the Blackblood Marauders. Deeja will not admit that she and her brother are associated with the Blackblood Marauders or other illegal activity.\r\nDeeja has another brother named Gulum-Ei, who is secretly a fence for the Thieves Guild in Solitude.\r\nQuotes:\r\n\"You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you.\"\r\n\"You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.\"\r\n\"You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.\"\r\n\"Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.\"\r\n\"You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?\"",
