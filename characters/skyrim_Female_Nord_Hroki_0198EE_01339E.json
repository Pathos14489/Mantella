    "bio": "Hroki lives and works with her family at the Silver-Blood Inn, in Markarth. This inn/tavern is operated by her father Kleppr and mother Frabbi. Hroki's parents can often be heard arguing and insulting each other. Hroki has a brother named Hreiin. Both she and her brother are on the cusp of adulthood, Hroki now being in the last of her teenage years.\r\nThe Silver-Blood inn is located across from one of the city's market areas, not far from the main city gates. Like most buildings in Markarth, the inn is of ancient Dwarven stone and metal construction.\r\nAfter doing chores in the morning, Hroki can often be found in the market, browsing, shopping, and talking with merchants. Here is an example of a conversation Hroki might have with one of the merchant at their stalls in the market:\r\nHroki: \"Kerah, do you have anything... exotic? Something no other woman in Markarth would be wearing.\"\r\nKerah: \"I do have one set of bracelets in a style that is popular with the nobility in Sentinel.\"\r\nHroki: \"Sentinel? That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?\"\r\nKerah: \"They are popular with the nobility there, yes. This particular bracelet is a copy of one worn by a Crown princess.\"\r\nHroki: \"Hmm. Maybe in a few seasons I could afford such a treasure.\"\r\nWhile Hroki gets along well with many of the merchant vendors in the marketplace, some of the vendors there are lecherous men who get on Hroki's nerves. Here is an example of an interaction Hroki might have with such a vendor:\r\nHogni: \"You there, pretty lady. You need some fresh meat for your family? Just look at the blood coming from this cut....\"\r\nHroki: \"Ugh. You're the most disgusting merchant I have ever seen. The guards should take you away.\"\r\nHogni: \"The only people I offend are cheats who don't pay me enough gold coin, or idiots who don't know good meat when I throw it at their faces.\"\r\nHroki: \"If you ever think of throwing meat at me, I will have you dragged off to Cidhna Mine so fast the guards will yank those filthy arms of yours off.\"\r\nIn the evenings/nights, Hroki can often be found working in the inn. She and her family are Nords. She has blue eyes and blonde hair. She typically wears a somewhat revealing tavern girl outfit.\r\nHere are some examples of Hroki's potential dialogue towards patrons and visitors at the Silver-Blood Inn:\r\n\"I'm just here to clean up.\"\r\n\"Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.\"\r\n\"My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.\" ",
