He and his wife Matlara were killed by a terrible black dragon when it attacked Helgen, breathing fire and raining down meteors from the sky. The dragon attacked after General Tullius, the Imperial military governor of Skyrim, began executing Stormcloak rebel prisoners within the town's square. Luckily, Torolf and Matlara\u2019s 11-year old son Haming was able to escape Helgen's destruction and survive. Torolf is the son of Froki Whetted-Blade, an old huntsman who rejects the pantheon of the Imperial Divines in favor of the older Nordic pantheon, specifically revering the goddess Kyne.",
