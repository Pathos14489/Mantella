    "bio": "Selveni Nethri is a Dunmer Necromancer who is trapped inside a spider's web after having been left to die in Southfringe Sanctum by Bashnag and her fellow Spellsword mages.\r\nSelveni initially joined Bashnag's circle of mages to study necromancy in peace, but could not stop thinking about her daughter, Savela, who had been sent to Honorhall Orphanage after Selveni was accused of practicing illegal necromancy. Eventually, Selveni snuck away from the Sanctum and made her way to Riften, hoping to find and steal away Savela. However, the girl had already left the orphanage and was nowhere to be found.\r\nNot knowing what else she could do, Selveni returned to the Southfringe Sanctum, hoping that nobody noticed she had left. Bashnag, however, did take notice of her absence, and upon her return, accused her of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. Afterwards, he cursed her ability to cast spells and chased her off into the depths of the sanctum, where she seemingly got caught in a web of one of the Frostbite Spiders that inhabit the cave.\r\nSelveni first asks to be cut down from the webs that hold her, and then requests further assistance so that she can escape the cave. After Bashnag and his circle of mages have been defeated, Selveni is told it is possible to escape through the cave's exit. She will thank the Dragonborn for their help and decides to once again continue the search for her daughter.",
