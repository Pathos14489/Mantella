    "bio": "Okapi is a miner working in the small village of Karthwasten. While she performs honest labor, her real intent is to earn enough money to return to the gambling pits, where she seeks to make her fortune betting on wolves.\r\nLike most Khajiit, she speaks in the third person, referring to herself as \"this one\". For example, if she wanted to express that she is tired, she would say \"This one is tired\".",
